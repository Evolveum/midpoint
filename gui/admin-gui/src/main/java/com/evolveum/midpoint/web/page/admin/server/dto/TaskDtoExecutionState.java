 * Original description:
 *  Adds "RUNNING" state to the TaskExecutionState (meaning the task is currently executing at a node).
 *  And also "SUSPENDING" if it is running, but marked as suspended.
 *
 * New meaning:
 *  Probably not needed any more. The RUNNING_OR_RUNNABLE is needed to query for the task state, and should not be here.

        <!-- When header panel contains visible label element with an inner text which is followed by the tooltip component,
         the screen reader cannot handle tooltip component behavior correctly. E.g. when the screen reader is active
         and the user is navigating through the page using arrow keys, the header panel is announced by the screen reader in
         such a way that label and tooltip components are announced at once. If user tries to activate tooltip by Enter or Space
         key button down event, nothing happens. As far, as label component doesn't have inner text, the screen reader handles
         label and tooltip components correctly: at first, label component is announced, then user can navigate with the help
         of arrow key to the tooltip component and can activate tooltip by Enter or Space key down event. This behavior of the
         screen reader is not clear for us now. Therefore, the following hack was implemented: a real label component (with
         inner text) was hidden from the screen reader but screen-reader-only component was added instead (it doesn't contain
         any inner text). 'srOnlyLabel' describes real label component, so the user will get the information about the label.

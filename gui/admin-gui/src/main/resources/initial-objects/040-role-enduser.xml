    <name>End user</name>
    <description>Role authorizing end users to log in, change their passwords and review assigned accounts. Note: This role definition is just an example. It should be tailored for each specific deployment.</description>
    <!--
        End user role is NOT archetyped as system role - by purpose.
        Firstly, this role is almost always customized. We do not want to create an impression that
        this role is finished and ready for production use.
        Secondly, it is not really a system role. It is perhaps closer to business role. We cannot
        clearly decide where it belongs as this depends on how the role hierarchy is structured.
        Therefore we have chosen not to mark it with any archetype to avoid risk of creating
        a confusing situation.

            selected properties such as name and description.

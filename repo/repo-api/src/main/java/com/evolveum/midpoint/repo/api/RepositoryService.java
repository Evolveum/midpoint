/**
 * <p>Identity Repository Interface.</p>
 * <p>
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Status: public</li>
 *   <li>Stability: stable</li>
 * </ul>
 * @version 3.1.1
 * @author Radovan Semancik
 * </p><p>
 * This service provides repository for objects that are commonly found
 * in identity management deployments. It is used for storage and retrieval
 * of objects. It also supports modifications (relative changes), searching
 * and basic coordination.
 * </p><p>
 * Supported object types:
 * <ul>
 *         <li>All object types from Common Schema</li>
 *         <li>All object types from Identity Schema</li>
 *         <li>All object types from IDM Model Schema</li>
 * </ul>
 * </p><p>
 * Identity repository may add some kind of basic logic in addition to a
 * pure storage of data. E.g. it may check referential consistency,
 * validate schema, etc.
 * </p><p>
 * The implementation may store the objects and properties in any suitable
 * way and it is not required to check any schema beyond the basic common schema
 * structures. However, the implementation MAY be able to check additional
 * schema definitions, e.g. to check for mandatory and allowed properties
 * and property types. This may be either explicit (e.g. implementation checking
 * against provided XML schema) or implicit, conforming to the constraints of
 * the underlying storage (e.g. LDAP schema enforced by underlying directory server).
 * One way or another, the implementation may fail to store the objects that violate
 * the schema. The method how the schemas are "loaded" to the implementation is not
 * defined by this interface. This interface even cannot "reveal" the schema to its
 * users (at least not now). Therefore clients of this interface must be prepared to
 * handle schema violation errors.
 * </p><p>
 * The implementation is not required to index the data or provide any other
 * optimizations. This depends on the specific implementation, its configuration
 * and the underlying storage system. Qualitative constraints (such as performance)
 * are NOT defined by this interface definition.
 * </p>
 * <h1>Naming Conventions</h1>
 * <p>
 * operations should be named as &lt;operation&gt;&lt;objectType&gt; e.g. addUser,
 * modifyAccount, searchObjects. The operations that returns single object
 * instance or works on single object should be named in singular (e.g. addUser).
 * The operation that return multiple instances should be named in plural (e.g. listObjects).
 * Operations names should be unified as well:
 * <ul>
 *        <li>add, modify, delete - writing to repository, single object, need OID</li>
 *        <li>get - retrieving single object by OID</li>
 *        <li>list - returning all objects, no or fixed search criteria</li>
 *        <li>search - returning subset of objects with flexible search criteria</li>
 * </ul>
 * </p>
 * <h1>Notes</h1>
 * <p>
 * The definition of this interface is somehow "fuzzy" at places. E.g.
 * allowing schema-aware implementation but not mandating it, recommending
 * to remove duplicates, but tolerating them, etc. The reason for this is
 * to have better fit to the underlying storage mechanisms and therefore
 * more efficient and simpler implementation. It may complicate the clients
 * if the code needs to be generic and fit each and every implementation of
 * this interface. However, such code will be quite rare. Most of the custom code
 * will be developed to work on a specific storage (e.g. Oracle DB or LDAP)
 * and therefore can be made slightly implementation-specific. Changing the
 * storage in a running IDM system is extremely unlikely.
 * </p>
 * <h1>TODO</h1>
 * <p>
 * <ul>
 *  <li>TODO: Atomicity, consistency</li>
 *  <li>TODO: security constraints</li>
 *  <li>TODO: inherently thread-safe</li>
 *  <li>TODO: note about distributed storage systems and weak/eventual consistency</li>
 *  <li>TODO: task coordination</li>
 * </ul>
 * </p>

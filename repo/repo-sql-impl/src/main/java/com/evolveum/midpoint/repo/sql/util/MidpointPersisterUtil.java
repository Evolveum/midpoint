/**
 * Hibernate seems to load ManyToOne association targets when doing "merge" or "object load" operation,
 * even though they are declared as LAZY.
 *
 * For recently-added "target" association in REmbeddedReference, RObjectReference and RCertCaseWorkItemReference
 * this is very unfortunate, as it leads to fetching the whole RObject instance (the target of the association),
 * which means joining approx. 20 tables - a huge overhead. For example, this adds an extra 50 milliseconds
 * in case of locally-run PostgreSQL database.
 *
 * What is interesting, we don't use values of this association in java objects in any way.
 * We created this association only to allow the use of left outer joins of referenced objects in HQL queries (see below).
 *
 * I've found no easy way how to prevent automatic loading of referenced objects.
 * (Unsuccessful attempts are listed below.)
 *
 * So here is the solution - quite an ugly hack.
 *
 * We provide a custom persister for every entity that contains the "target" association. (It is the majority
 * of entities, mainly because REmbeddedReference is used in many objects.) The persister modifies the hydrate() method,
 * responsible for translation of database rows into Java entity objects. More specifically, after invoking
 * original hydrate() method, we erase any traces of "target" ManyToOne association values, replacing them by nulls.
 * Of course, this means that such values will not be accessible within hydrated POJOs. But we don't care: we
 * do not need them there. The only reason of their existence is to allow their retrieval via HQL queries.
 *
 * Drawbacks/limitations:
 * 1) As mentioned, association values cannot be retrieved from POJOs. Only by HQL.
 * 2) Custom persister has to be manually declared on all entities that directly or indirectly contain
 *    the "target" association; otherwise the performance when getting/merging such entities will be (silently) degraded.
 * 3) When declaring the persister, one has to correctly determine its type (Joined/SingleTable one).
 *    One can help himself by looking at which persister is used by hibernate itself
 *    (e.g. by calling sessionFactoryImpl.getEntityPersisters).
 * 4) Current implementation is quite simple minded as it expects that the name of association is
 *    "target". This might collide with other ManyToOne associations with that name. (Although currently there are none.)
 *    In future we could create some annotation to select associations to be "killed".
 * 5) It is unclear if this solution would work with persisters with batch loading enabled. Fortunately,
 *    we currently don't use this feature in midPoint.
 *
 * Alternative solutions:
 * 1) One almost-working attempt was to declare the field as lazy in the "no-proxy" way
 *    (@LazyToOne(LazyToOneOption.NO_PROXY)). However, it has 2 drawbacks:
 *    A) there are still SELECTs executed in such situations (perhaps one per each association)
 *    B) it required build-time instrumentation, which failed on RObject for unclear reasons
 *    Even if B would be solved, problem A is still there, leading to performance penalties.
 * 2) Elimination of associations altogether. It possible to fetch targets in HQL even without the associations by
 *    simply listing more (unrelated) classes in FROM clause. However, this leads to inner, not left outer joins.
 *    The effect is that objects that have targets with null or non-existent OIDs are not included in the result,
 *    which is obviously unacceptable. Explicit joins for unrelated classes cannot be used for now
 *    (https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HHH-16).
 * 3) Using "target" associations only for references that need them. This feature is currently used only
 *    for certifications, so it would be possible to create RResolvableEmbeddedReference and use it for
 *    certification case entity. (Plus at some other places.) The performance degradation would be limited
 *    to these entities. However, other modules would not be able to employ displaying/selecting/ordering by
 *    e.g. referenced object names (or other properties).
 *
 * If it would turn out that no harm is caused by this hack, it could be kept here.
 * If not, alternative #3 should be employed. After HHH-16 is provided, we should implement alternative #2.

/**
 * Gizmo (device,gadget,thing) that handles search filters and other filter-like things during security processing of search filters.
 *
 * Normal authorization evaluation will work directly with search filters. But there are other cases when we want to work with
 * something else. For example, we may want to divide search filters based on relation, e.g. for the purposes of evaluating
 * assignable roles. We may also want to divide the filters according to other criteria. Those "gizmos" can be used to
 * do that.
 *
 * The gizmo could also be used to annotate the resulting filter. E.g. we might be able to put name of the authoriztion into
 * each filter for diagnostic purposes.
 *
 * @param <F> SearchFilter or other filter-like things (e.g. RoleSelectionSpecification)

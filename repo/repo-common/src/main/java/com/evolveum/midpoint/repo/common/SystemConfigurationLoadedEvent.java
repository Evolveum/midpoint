/**
 * Application event related to system configuration being (re)loaded by {@link SystemObjectCache}.

 *
 * The purpose of this event is to keep pre-4.6 behavior of cleaning expression profile cache
 * not only when system configuration is known to be changed (see {@link SystemConfigurationChangeEvent})
 * but also when the system configuration is known to be reloaded by {@link SystemObjectCache}. The latter
 * can occur more frequently because of safety checks that are there to ensure the system configuration
 * is up-to-date even if some change events are missed.
 *
 * TODO reconsider this - it looks really ugly

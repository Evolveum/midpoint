1. Prerequisites:

    1. Java (JDK) 17 or 21
    2. Apache Maven 3
    3. midPoint source code retrieved via Git

2. Compile sources

2.1 Building sources with tests

Execute the following maven command:

   mvn install

Note: building midPoint with the tests takes considerably long time (approx. 1 hour)

2.2 Building sources without tests

   mvn install -DskipTests=true

2.3 Compiled distribution package

After the build is complete the distribution archives are available in:

   dist/target/

2.4 Install the distribution

Unpack the distribution package to a convenient place (e.g. /opt/midpoint)

2.5 Start midPoint server

Use the start.sh (or start.bat) script in the bin directory:

   bin/start.sh

2.6 Access the GUI

MidPoint web GUI should be accessible few moments after the web container
starts and the application initialization is done. It is accessible on following
URL by default:

  http://localhost:8080/

Login: administrator

If you did not configure initial administrator password, you should search logs
(var/log/midpoint.log) for Administrator initial password. The password may contain
spaces, so it is enclosed with double quotes. Do not forget to remove quotes.

For more information about initial administrator password, please see:

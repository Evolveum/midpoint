 * is a JMS queue that is accessed via MessageConsumer.receive() method. An example of the latter is a JMS queue that is accessed
 * via message listener, i.e. using MessageConsumer.setMessageListener() method. Or REST endpoint that receives messages as they
 * arrive.
 *
 * An instance of this interface is created by calling static method create(AsyncUpdateSourceType configuration)
 * on the implementing class.

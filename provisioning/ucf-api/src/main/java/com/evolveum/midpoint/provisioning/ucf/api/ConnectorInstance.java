/**
 * Connector instance configured for a specific resource.
 *
 * This is kind of connector facade. It is an API provided by the "Unified Connector Framework" to the midPoint provisioning
 * component. There is no associated SPI yet. That may come in the future when this interface stabilizes a bit.
 *
 * This interface provides an unified facade to a connector capabilities in the Unified Connector Framework interface.
 * The connector is configured to a specific resource instance and therefore can execute operations on resource.
 *
 * Calls to this interface always try to reach the resource and get the actual state on resource. The connectors are
 * not supposed to cache any information. Therefore the methods do not follow get/set java convention as the data
 * are not regular javabean properties.
 *
 * This instance must know the most current version of the resource schema, even with the refinements.

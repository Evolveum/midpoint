/**
 * Interface to Unified Connector functionality.
 *
 * This is considered the "main" interface of the Unified Connector
 * Framework (UCF) API. It can be used to instantiate connectors which in
 * turn can be used to invoke operations on resources.
 *
 * The UCF interface is considered to be an abstraction internal to the
 * midPoint project and not really reusable. It is using objects from the
 * midPoint data model. But the longer-term ambition is to use this
 * interface as an prototype of ICF replacement, as ICF is burdened by
 * numerous problems.
 *
 * Calls to this interface always try to reach the resource and get the
 * actual state on resource. The connectors are not supposed to cache any
 * information. Therefore the methods do not follow get/set java convention
 * as the data are not regular javabean properties.

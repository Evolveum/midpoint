/**
 * Provisioning Service Interface
 *
 * * Status: public
 * * Stability: STABLE, only compatible changes are expected
 *
 * This service retrieves information about resource objects and resources
 * and handles changes to resource objects. Implementations of this interface
 * will apply the changes to accounts, groups and other similar objects to the
 * target resources. It also provides information about connectors and similar
 * configuration of access to the resources.
 *
 * Supported object types:
 *
 *  * Resource
 *  * Shadow
 *  * Connector
 *
 *
 * TODO: better documentation
 *
 * NOTE: Because there is currently only a single implementation of this interface, we have the luxury to provide some
 * implementation-level restrictions and comments here, without having to write them separately into the implementation
 * class. This may change in the future.

     * |===
     *
     * (*) This is `shadowLifecycleState` property that does not exist in the repository (yet). It is computed by
     * the implementation of this method.
     *
     * === Required resource capabilities
     *
     * The "read" capability of resource and relevant object type (if applicable) is checked. Operation fails if it is not
     * present or enabled. If "caching-only" is set, reading from resource is avoided.
     *
     * === Shadow refresh
     *
     * The shadow is refreshed after it's fetched from the repository in the following modes:
     *
     * [%autowidth]
     * [%header]
     * |===
     * | Condition                | Refresh mode
     * | resource in maintenance  | none (may change in future)
     * | forceRefresh option      | full
     * | forceRetry option        | full
     * | refreshOnRead is set     | full
     * | otherwise                | quick
     * |===
     *
     * - "Full refresh" is equivalent to {@link #refreshShadow(PrismObject, ProvisioningOperationOptions, Task, OperationResult)}.
     * - "Quick refresh" is a subset of it: deleting expired pending operations and deleting the expired dead shadow.
     * This may change in the future.
     *
     * === Avoiding reading from the resource
     *
     * Reading from the resource is avoided in specific conditions, namely if:
     *
     * . The resource or object type has "caching-only" read capability.
     * . Resource is in maintenance mode.
     * . A shadow is in specific near-birth or near-death state. See the implementation (`GetOperation`) for details.
     * . Using the cached version is required by the staleness and point-in-time options.
     *
     * In specific conditions the implementation may decide to handle the fact that the object does not exist on the resource.
     *
     * === Post-processing of the resource object fetched
     *
     * When a resource object is successfully read from the resource, the following should occur:
     *
     * . Shadow is classified - either if it was not classified yet, or the resource is in "development mode" (see below).
     * . Repository shadow is updated with known data obtained from the resource. This includes e.g. cached attributes.
     *
     * === Shadow futurization
     *
     * When `future` point of time is requested, the pending operations are applied to the last known state of the shadow.
     * (Fetched either from the resource or from repository.) The current implementation is not 100% correct, as it tries
     * to apply all attribute deltas even if the base object does not have all the attributes available.
     *
     * === Shadow fetch result specifics
     *
     * When the resource object is being fetched from the resource, and:
     *
     * . {@link CommunicationException} occurs, the status is `PARTIAL_ERROR` (and repo shadow is returned),
     * . resource is in maintenance, the status is `PARTIAL_ERROR` (and repo shadow is returned),
     * . {@link ObjectNotFoundException} occurs, the status is `HANDLED_ERROR` (and repo shadow with the `dead` flag is returned).
     * The reason is that the exception was, in fact, handled. The current state of the object is correctly reported.
     *
     * === Potential side effects
     *
     * . Quick or full shadow refresh - before the GET issued against resource (or after the repo load if noFetch is set).
     * The shadow may be even deleted by the refresh.
     * . Discovery process (an event is sent to the listener, typically to model).
     * . Shadow is updated with the information obtained from the resource: cached identifiers and/or other attributes,
     * probably `dead` and `exists` properties.
     * . ...
     *
     * TODO think about compatibility of these side effects with the limitations prescribed by development/execution mode.
     *
     * === Effects of development and execution mode
     *
     * The following configuration items should be respected:
     *
     * * `lifecycleState` in resource and/or object type - drives e.g. the classification process
     * * shadow production/non-production flag - also drives the classification
     *
     * TODO specify in mode details
     *
     * == ResourceType objects
     *
     * The returned object will conform to the following:
     *
     * [%autowidth]
     * [%header]
     * |===
     * | State/condition                        | Is expanded | Configuration is resolved | Has capabilities and schema | Is put into cache
     * | current version is in cache            | yes         | yes                       | yes (taken from cache)      | it is already there
     * | is abstract                            | yes         | no                        | if present in repo          | no
     * | is complete in repo                    | yes         | yes                       | yes (taken from repo)       | yes
     * | is incomplete in repo, noFetch = false | yes         | yes                       | yes (fetched)               | yes (if no problems)
     * | is incomplete in repo, noFetch = true  | yes         | yes                       | if present in repo          | no
     * | raw = true                             | no          | only the definitions      | if present in repo          | no
     * |===
     *
     * Notes:
     *
     * . If the current version of the object is in the resource cache, it is returned right from it.
     * . "Is expanded" = the references to super-resources are resolved.
     * . "Configuration is resolved" = definitions of individual configuration properties (from the connector schema)
     * are applied; also, the expressions in these properties are evaluated.
     * . "Has capabilities and schema" = whether native capabilities and schema information is present in the returned object.
     * "If present in repo" means that the information from the repository are returned.
     * . "Is put into cache" = whether the resource is put into the resource cache, so it can be cheaply retrieved afterwards.
     * . "Is complete in repo" means that both capabilities and schema are fetched - see
     * {@link ResourceTypeUtil#isComplete(ResourceType)}.

     * | errorHandling              | ignored
     * |===
     *
     * === Potential side effects
     *
     * . If a resource undergoes completion, the capabilities and/or schema are updated in the repository.
     * . The complete resource may be put into the cache.
     *
     * === Effects of development and execution mode
     *
     * They are none. The definition of the resource is the same, regardless of the mode we run in. For example, it is cached
     * regardless of the mode. However, the interpretation of the definition differs, but that is outside the scope of this
     * method.
     *
     * (This may change if we would e.g. apply some "patches" specific to individual modes.)
     *
     * == ConnectorType and other objects
     *
     * These objects are just retrieved from the repository. They are not treated in any special way now.
     *
     * === Potential side effects
     *
     * None.
     *
     * === Effects of development and execution mode
     *
     * None.
     *
     * == Notes
     *
     * . Concrete type of object (`ShadowType`, `ResourceType`, and so on) must be provided by the client.
     * Using generic `ObjectType` will not work.
     * . The operation result is cleaned up before returning.
     * . The fetch result ({@link ObjectType#getFetchResult()}) is stored into object being returned. It reflects the result
     * of the whole operation: fetching from the resource, if applicable, but also e.g. application of definitions to an
     * object retrieved in raw mode. Storing of "success" result may be skipped.
     *
     * == Limitations / Known issues
     *
     * . Getting shadows: Definitions of associations (identifiers) are not always refined (in noFetch mode).

     * |===
     *
     * === Specifying the "coordinates"
     *
     * When dealing with shadow queries in non-raw mode, there are the following requirements on the query:
     *
     * . there must be exactly one `resourceRef` obtainable from the query (i.e. present in the conjunction at the root level),
     * . and
     * .. either `kind` is specified (optionally with `intent` and/or `objectClass`),
     * .. or `objectClass` is specified (and both `kind` and `intent` are not specified).
     *
     * See also {@link ObjectQueryUtil#getOperationCoordinates(ObjectFilter)}.
     *
     * === Interpreting the query for on-resource search
     *
     * ==== If `kind` is specified
     * In this case, a specific _object type_ definition is looked up: either by `kind` and `intent` (if the latter is present),
     * or - if `intent` is not specified - by looking for a type marked as "default for its kind". The search is then executed
     * against this object type, taking its delineation (object class, base context, additional filters) into account.
     *
     * If `objectClass` is specified as well, it is just checked against the value in given object type definition. (Hence it
     * is not necessary nor advisable to specify object class when kind is specified.)
     *
     * ==== If only `objectClass` is specified
     * Here the implementation searches for all objects of given `objectClass`. However, there are few things that must be done
     * during the search, for example determining "attributes to get" i.e. what attributes should be explicitly requested.
     * These things depend on object class or object type definition. Therefore, the implementation has to look up appropriate
     * definition first.
     *
     * It does so by looking up raw or refined object class definition. Also, if there is a type definition marked as "default for
     * object class", it is used. However, even if such a type definition is found, the delineation (base context, filters, and
     * so on) are ignored: as stated above, all objects of given object class are searched for.
     *
     * See {@link ResourceSchemaUtil#findDefinitionForBulkOperation(ResourceType, ShadowKindType, String, QName)}
     * and {@link ResourceSchemaUtil#findObjectDefinitionPrecisely(ResourceType, ShadowKindType, String, QName)} for
     * the details.
     *
     * === Extra resource objects
     *
     * Note that when using kind and/or intent, the method may return objects that do not match these conditions. It depends
     * on how precise is the respective type definition, namely if its delineation: base context, hierarchy scope,
     * and/or object filter(s) precisely describe objects that belong to this type. If these features do not describe
     * the type adequately (e.g. if the classification has to be done using conditions written in Groovy), then the
     * returned set of objects may contain ones that are not of requested type. It is then the responsibility of the
     * caller to sort these extra objects out.
     *
     * === Potential side effects
     *
     * . Shadow is updated with the information obtained from the resource: cached identifiers and/or other attributes,
     * probably `dead` and `exists` properties.
     * . TODO
     *
     * === Effects of development and execution mode
     *
     * TODO
     *
     * == Processing of {@link ResourceType} objects
     *
     * Just like the {@link #getObject(Class, String, Collection, Task, OperationResult)} method, the resources returned from
     * this one are processed according to the inheritance rules, unless the `raw` mode is applied. Beware that - obviously -
     * the search query is applied to find the original resource objects, not the "processed" ones.
     *
     * - TODO expand this part
     * - TODO side effects
     *
     * === Effects of development and execution mode
     *
     * TODO
     *
     * == Fetch result
     *
     * The fetch result ({@link ObjectType#getFetchResult()}) should be present in objects returned (namely, if the processing
     * was not entirely successful). Beware that the details of storing it may differ between this method and
     * {@link #getObject(Class, String, Collection, Task, OperationResult)}.
     *
     * == Issues
     *
     * . Currently, we apply the object definition when fetching the object in raw mode.
     * This is a bit inconsistent with the processing in `get` operation, and also a bit unexpected.
     *

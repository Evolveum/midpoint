/**
 * A change processor can be viewed as a kind of framework supporting customer-specific
 * approvals code. Individual change processors are specialized in their areas, allowing
 * customer code to focus on business logic with minimal effort.
 *
 * The name "change processor" is derived from the fact that main purpose of this
 * framework is to process change requests coming from the model.
 *
 * However, a change processor has many more duties, e.g.
 *
 * 1. recognizes the instance (instances) of given kind of change within model operation context,
 * 2. processes the result of the approval case objects when they are finished,
 * 3. presents (externalizes) the content of approval cases to outside world: to the GUI, auditing, and notifications.
 *
 * Currently, there is only a single change processor implemented. It is {@link PrimaryChangeProcessor} that manages
 * approvals of changes of objects that are captured during `primary` model state processing. They may deal with focus
 * or with a projection, but they must be entered by the user - i.e. _not_ determined by the projector.
 *
 * NOTE: Because the {@link PrimaryChangeProcessor} is the only one that is currently available, the code is not very
 * clean in this respect. Some parts of existing code assume that this is the only processor, while others are more
 * universal. Because we simply do not know for sure, we - for now - leave the code in this state: we neither do not
 * generalize it to multiple processors, nor we simplify it to concentrate on this single processor.

     * know in advance whether other processors would not want to process the invocation from the model.

/**
 * Implements gathering and evaluation of inbound mappings: both during clockwork and before it (for correlation purposes).
 *
 * Main classes:
 *
 * 1. {@link com.evolveum.midpoint.model.impl.lens.projector.focus.inbounds.FullInboundsProcessing}: provides complete
 * processing during clockwork, i.e. collecting, evaluating, and consolidating inbound mappings.
 *
 * 2. {@link com.evolveum.midpoint.model.impl.lens.projector.focus.inbounds.SingleShadowInboundsProcessing}: provides processing before
 * the clockwork.
 *
 * Among helper classes, _mapping preparation_ is the most complex operation. It is carried out by classes in
 * {@link com.evolveum.midpoint.model.impl.lens.projector.focus.inbounds.prep} package.

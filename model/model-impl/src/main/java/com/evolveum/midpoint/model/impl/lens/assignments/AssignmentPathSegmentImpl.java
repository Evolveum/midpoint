/*
 *  Assignments and inducements can carry constructions, focus mappings, and policy rules.
 *  We can call these "assignment/inducement payload", or "payload" for short.
 *
 *  When looking at assignments/inducements in assignment path, payload of some assignments/inducements will be collected
 *  to focus, while payload from others will be not. How we know what to collect?
 *
 *  For assignments/inducements belonging directly to the focus, we take payload from all the assignments. Not from inducements.
 *  For assignments/inducements belonging to roles (assigned to focus), we take payload from all the inducements of order 1.
 *  For assignments/inducements belonging to meta-roles (assigned to roles), we take payload from all the inducements of order 2.
 *  And so on. (It is in fact a bit more complicated, as described below when discussing relations. But OK for the moment.)
 *
 *  To know whether to collect payload from assignment/inducement, i.e. from assignment path segment, we
 *  define "isMatchingOrder" attribute - and collect only if value of this attribute is true.
 *
 *  How we compute this attribute?
 *
 *  Each assignment path segment has an evaluation order. First assignment has an evaluation order of 1, second
 *  assignment has an order of 2, etc. Order of a segment can be seen as the number of assignments segments in the path
 *  (including itself). And, for "real" assignments (i.e. not inducements), we collect payload from assignment segments
 *  of order 1.
 *
 *  But what about inducements? There are two - somewhat related - questions:
 *
 *  1. How we compute isMatchingOrder for inducement segments?
 *  2. How we compute evaluation order for inducement segments?
 *
 *  As for #1: To compute isMatchingOrder, we must take evaluation order of the _previous_ segment, and compare
 *  it with the order (or, more generally, order constraints) of the inducement. If they match, we say that inducement
 *  has matching order.
 *
 *  As for #2: It is not usual that inducements have targets (roles) with another assignments, i.e. that evaluation continues
 *  after an inducement segment. But it definitely could happen. We can look at it this way: inducement is something like
 *  a "shortcut" that creates an assignment where no assignment was before. E.g. if we have R1 -A-> MR1 -I-> MR2,
 *  the "newly created" assignment is R1 -A-> MR2. I.e. as if the " -A-> MR1 -I-> " part was just replaced by " -A-> ".
 *  If the inducement is of higher order, even more assignments are "cut out". From R1 -A-> MR1 -A-> MMR1 -(I2)-> MR2
 *  we have R1 -A-> MR2, i.e. we cut out " -A-> MR1 -A-> MMR1 -(I2)-> " and replaced it by " -A-> ".
 *  So it looks like that when computing new evaluation order of an inducement, we have to "go back" few steps
 *  through the assignment path.
 *
 *  Such situation can also easily occur when org structures are used. As depicted in TestAssignmentProcessor2.test500
 *  and later, imagine this:
 *
 *           Org1 -----I----+                                              Org2 -----I----+
 *             ^            | (orderConstraints 1..N)                        ^            | (orderConstraints: manager: 1)
 *             |            |                                                |            |
 *             |            V                                                |            V
 *           Org11        Admin                                            Org21        Admin
 *             ^                                                             ^
 *             |                                                         (manager)
 *             |                                                             |
 *            jack                                                          jack
 *
 *  In order to resolve such cases, we created the "resetOrder" attribute. It can be applied either to
 *  summary order, or to one or more specific relations (please, don't specify it for both summary order
 *  and specific relations!)
 *
 *  In the above examples, we could specify e.g. resetOrder=1 for summary order (for both left and right situation).
 *  For the right one, we could instead specify resetOrder=0 for org:manager relation; although the former solution
 *  is preferable.
 *
 *  By simply specifying inducement order greater than 1 (e.g. 5) without any specific order constraints,
 *  we implicitly provide resetOrder instruction for summary order that points order-1 levels back (i.e. 4 levels back
 *  for order=5).
 *
 *  Generally, it is preferred to use resetOrder for summary order. It works well with both normal and target
 *  evaluation order. When resetting individual components, target evaluation order can have problems, as shown
 *  in TestEvaluationProcessor2.test520.
 *
 *  ----
 *
 *  Because evaluation order can "increase" and "decrease", it is possible that it goes to zero or below, and then
 *  increase back to positive numbers. Is that OK? Imagine this:
 *
 *  (Quite an ugly example, but such things might exist.)
 *
 *  Metarole:CrewMember ----I----+  Metarole:Sailors
 *           A                   |  A
 *           |                   |  |
 *           |                   V  |
 *         Pirate               Sailor
 *           A
 *           |
 *           |
 *          jack
 *
 *  When evaluating jack->Pirate assignment, it is OK to collect from everything (Pirate, CrewMember, Sailor, Sailors).
 *
 *  But when evaluating Pirate as a focal object (forget about jack for the moment), we have Pirate->CrewMember assignment.
 *  For this assignment we should ignore payload from Sailor (obviously, because the order is not matching), but from
 *  Metarole:Sailors as well. Payload from Sailors is not connected to Pirate in any meaningful way. (For example, if
 *  Sailors prescribes an account construction for Sailor, it is of no use to collect this construction when evaluating
 *  Pirate as focal object!)
 *
 *  Evaluating relations
 *  ====================
 *
 *  With the arrival of various kinds of relations (deputy, manager, approver, owner) things got a bit complicated.
 *  For instance, the deputy relation cannot be used to determine evaluation order in a usual way, because if
 *  we have this situation:
 *
 *  Pirate -----I-----> Sailor
 *    A
 *    | (default)
 *    |
 *   jack
 *    A
 *    | (deputy)
 *    |
 *  barbossa
 *
 *  we obviously want to have barbossa to obtain all payload from roles Pirate and Sailor: exactly as jack does.
 *  So, the evaluation order of " barbossa -A-> jack -A-> Pirate " should be 1, not two. So deputy is a very special
 *  kind of relation, that does _not_ increase the traditional evaluation order. But we really want to record
 *  the fact that the deputy is on the assignment path; therefore, besides traditional "scalar" evaluation order
 *  (called "summaryOrder") we maintain evaluation orders for each relation separately. In the above example,
 *  the evaluation orders would be:
 *     barbossa--->jack     summary: 0, deputy: 1, default: 0
 *     jack--->Pirate       summary: 1, deputy: 1, default: 1
 *     Pirate-I->Sailor     summary: 1, deputy: 1, default: 1 (because the inducement has a default order of 1)
 *
 *  When we determine matchingOrder for an inducement (question #1 above), we can ask about summary order,
 *  as well as about individual components (deputy and default, in this case).
 *
 *  Actually, we have three categories of relations (see MID-3581):
 *
 *  - membership relations: apply membership references, payload, authorizations, gui config
 *  - delegation relations: similar to membership, bud different handling of order
 *  - other relations: apply membership references but in limited way; payload, authorizations and gui config
 *    are - by default - not applied.
 *
 *  Currently, membership relations are: default (i.e. member), manager, and meta.
 *  Delegation: deputy.
 *  Other: approver, owner, and custom ones.
 *
 *  As for the "other" relations: they bring membership information, but limited to the target that is directly
 *  assigned. So if jack is an approver for role Landluber, his roleMembershipRef will contain ref to Landluber
 *  but not e.g. to role Earthworm that is induced by Landluber. In a similar way, payload from targets assigned
 *  by "other" relations is not collected.
 *
 *  Both of this can be overridden by using specific orderConstraints on particular inducement.
 *  Set of order constraint is considered to match evaluation order with "other" relations, if for each such "other"
 *  relation it contains related constraint. So, if one explicitly wants an inducement to be applied when
 *  "approver" relation is encountered, he may do so.
 *
 *  Note: authorizations and gui config information are not considered to be a payload of assignment,
 *  because they are not part of an assignment/inducement - they are payload of a role. In the future we
 *  might move them into assignments/inducements.
 *
 *  Collecting target policy rules
 *  ==============================
 *
 *  Special consideration must be given when collecting target policy rules, i.e. rules that are attached to
 *  assignment targets. Such rules are typically attached to roles that are being assigned. So let's consider this:
 *
 *  rule1 (e.g. assignment approval policy rule)
 *    A
 *    |
 *    |
 *  Pirate
 *    A
 *    |
 *    |
 *   jack
 *
 *  When evaluating jack->Pirate assignment, rule1 would not be normally taken into account, because its assignment
 *  (Pirate->rule1) has an order of 2. However, we want to collect it - but not as an item related to focus, but
 *  as an item related to evaluated assignment's target. Therefore besides isMatchingOrder we maintain isMatchingOrderForTarget
 *  that marks all segments (assignments/inducements) that contain policy rules relevant to the evaluated assignment's target.
 *
 *  The computation is done by maintaining two evaluationOrders:
 *   - plain evaluationOrder that is related to the focus object [starts from ZERO.advance(first assignment relation)]
 *   - special evaluationOrderForTarget that is related to the target of the assignment being evaluated [starts from ZERO]
 *
 *  Finally, how we distinguish between "this target" and "other targets" policy rules? Current approach
 *  is like this: count the number of times the evaluation order for target reached ZERO level. First encounter with
 *  that level is on "this target". And we assume that each subsequent marks a target that is among "others".
 *

/**
 * When new assignments are being created (either as part of focus "add" or "modify" operation), we need to know their PCV IDs
 * beforehand. Otherwise, we are not able to create final `roleMembershipRef` value metadata for them (as they contain complete
 * assignment paths), resulting in multiple execution-stage audit events: first one with no-ID assignment paths in metadata,
 * and second one with correct assignment paths (having IDs). See MID-8659.
 *
 * The solution lies in acquiring assignment PCV IDs in earlier stages of the processing (from the repository).
 *
 * However, we _do not_ store the IDs in the assignments themselves, as their are sometimes re-generated (e.g. by mappings),
 * and the IDs could be easily lost. Hence, we store these IDs in {@link #generatedIdsMap} here instead. They are stored
 * in {@link EvaluatedAssignmentImpl#externalAssignmentId} (and at other similar places), and provided to appropriate places
 * during the computations; and, of course, implanted into deltas before the execution, so they are persistently stored
 * in the repository.
 *
 * NOTE: {@link TemporaryContainerIdStore} addresses a similar problem. However, in that case, IDs are not really important,
 * and they can be safely discarded when the delta is executed. (Unlike this case, where we need to keep them.)

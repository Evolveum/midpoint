     Configuration to be used for tests derived from AbstractEmptyModelIntegrationTest.

     If we'll find something that must be in really _all_ the tests, we will put it here.
     But currently it seems we can go with really empty configuration. (No configuration would
     be OK as well but in any running midPoint there is a system configuration object, so let's
     keep the situation close to the reality.)

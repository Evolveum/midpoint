/**
 *  Adds recompute triggers to objects in an optimized way:
 *  - The triggers are set to a given time in future (e.g. 1 minute from now).
 *  - If more requests to create triggers to the same object come before that time comes (minus some safety margin,
 *    e.g. 2 seconds), their creation is skipped.
 *
 *  Currently we deal only with the recompute triggers. Other types can be added as necessary.
 *
 *  The deduplication currently assumes the requests are of the same kind (i.e. either name-based or OID-based).

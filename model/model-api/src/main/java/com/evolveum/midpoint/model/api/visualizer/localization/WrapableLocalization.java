 * Localization composed of multiple "parts", which can be "wrapped" to some other object.
 *
 * Clients of the interface may chain more "wrappings" with the {@link #wrap} method. When all the wrappings are set,
 * the {@link #combineParts(Collector)} or the {@link #combineParts(Object, LocalizationPartsCombiner)} methods could
 * be used to specify the combination function, which will "combine" all localization together after their translation.
 *
 * Implementations of this interface should implement all methods in a "lazy fashion". That means, the underlying
 * "parts" should not be manipulated in any way. They should be only "prepared" for the actual "manipulation"
 * (wrapping, combining), which may eventually happen upon the method calls on returned {@link LocalizableObject}.
 *
 * @param <T> the type of the current wrapper object
 * @param <C> the type of the context object with extra data about the individual localization parts.

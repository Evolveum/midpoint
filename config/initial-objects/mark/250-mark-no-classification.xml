    <description>Mark for objects (usually applications) that are not properly classified.</description>
    <documentation>
        This mark is named "No classification" rather than "Unclassified" to avoid confusion.
        The term "unclassified" is commonly used to describe objects that are not classified for any secrecy class,
        e.i. objects that are not restricted, secret or top secret.
        This means that "unclassified" usually means "unrestricted" or "public".
        However, this means that "unclassified" is a classification on its own.
        Therefore, this mark and all other related configuration using term "no classification" rather than "unclassified".

base.psn.trim=PolyString normalizer trim. Removes whitespace from beginning and end of the string. Trimming is done before any other processing.
base.psn.nfkd=PolyString normalizer NFKD. Unicode Normalization Form Compatibility Decomposition (NFKD). \
This process expands composed characters (e.g. diacritic marks, ligatures, roman numerals). \
Character components are then processed individually. E.g. ascii7 normalizer \
will then remove just the diacritic mark, but leave the base letter. Therefore, \
for a-acute character with NFKD processing the output will be plain "a" character. \
Without NFKD processing the whole character will be removed.

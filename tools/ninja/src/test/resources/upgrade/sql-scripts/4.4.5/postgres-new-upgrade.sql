-- @formatter:off because of terribly unreliable IDEA reformat for SQL
-- This is the update script for the MAIN REPOSITORY, it will not work for a separate audit database.
-- It is safe to run this script repeatedly, so if you're not sure, just run it to be up to date.
-- DO NOT use explicit COMMIT commands inside the apply_change blocks - leave that to the procedure.
-- If necessary, split your changes into multiple apply_changes calls to enforce the commit
-- before another change - for example when adding values to the custom enum types.

-- Using psql is strongly recommended, don't use tools with messy autocommit behavior like pgAdmin!
-- Using flag to stop on first error is also recommended, for example:
-- psql -v ON_ERROR_STOP=1 -h localhost -U midpoint -W -d midpoint -f postgres-new-upgrade.sql

-- SCHEMA-COMMIT is a Git commit which should be used to initialize the DB for testing changes below it.
-- Check out that commit and initialize a fresh DB with postgres-new-audit.sql to test upgrades.

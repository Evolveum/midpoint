In this scenario we'll show four-stage approvals for role assignments.
Assignment of each critical role will be approved at two to four stages, by the following actors:

[%autowidth]
|===
| Stage | Approvers | Mode | Note

| 1
| manager(s) of the role assignee
| "All must approve", i.e. if there are more managers (either because the user is a member of more organizations, or an organization has more than one manager), all of the must approve the request.
| If there are no managers, the request will be rejected outright.


| 2
| members of Security Approvers organization
| "First decides", i.e. first member that provides the decision will approve request (at this stage), or reject it altogether.
| Applicable only for selected roles.


| 3
| members of SoD Approvers organization
| "First decides"
| Applicable only for selected roles.


| 4
| approvers specific for the given role
| Either "All must approve" or "First decides", based on the configuration.
| If there are no approvers, the request will be rejected.


|===

Files for this scenario are in the link:https://github.com/Evolveum/midpoint/tree/master/testing/story/src/test/resources/strings[testing/story/strings directory]. Let's have a look at most important ones.

Contrary to legacy (pre-3.5) approach where the approval process had to be defined as a single unit, starting from midPoint 3.5 a declarative approach, based on xref:/midpoint/reference/roles-policies/policy-rules/[policy rules], can be used.
These policy rules can be system-wide (defined in system configuration) or specifically assigned, usually via metaroles.
The latter approach is used in this scenario.

There are five metaroles:

[%autowidth]
|===
| Metarole | Meaning | Note

| metarole-approval-line-managers
| When assigning a role that possesses this metarole, an approval of assignee's line managers is required.
| Priority (order) of this approval schema fragment is 10.


| metarole-approval-security
| When assigning a role that possesses this metarole, an approval of someone from Security Approvers org is required.
| Order of this schema fragment is 20.


| metarole-approval-sod
| When assigning a role that possesses this metarole, an approval of someone from SoD Approvers org is required.
| Order of this schema fragment is 30.Note that this is just a placeholder for future policy rule that will detect actual SoD violation, and arrange this approval only if there's some.


| metarole-approval-role-approvers-all
| When assigning a role that possesses this metarole, all role approvers (i.e. users that have an assignment to the role with the relation = approver) has to approve the assignment.
| Order of this schema fragment is 40.


| metarole-approval-role-approvers-first
| The same as previous, but first of role approvers will decide on the request.
It is expected that at most one of these two metaroles will be assigned to a given role.
| Order of this schema fragment is 40.


|===

By specifying the priority (order) of approval schema fragments we can specify the ordering of steps in the overall approval schema.

Let's have a look at the metaroles.

----

This metarole induces a policy rule such that

* *if* a role (having this policy rule) is assigned,

* *then* approval of "midpoint.getManagerOidsExceptUser(object)" - i.e. managers of a given user - is requested.
If there are none of them, the request is rejected.

[NOTE]
====
Both `allMustApprove` and `reject` values are default ones for the particular fields, so they could be omitted if needed.
====


[WARNING]
====
MidPoint 3.5 and 3.6 differ in the interpretation of the situation when there are no approvers defined.
In 3.5, "no approvers" means the request is automatically approved.
In 3.6, this behavior is configurable using `outcomeIfNoApprovers` property; with the default being `reject`. (So there is a behavior change.)

In this case we allocate the corresponding work item to all members of the *Security Approvers* org.
When dealing with "groups" of users (either org or roles) there are two possibilities:

. *A work item is created for all members of the "group" (org or role).* These users can claim the work item and complete it - or release it back.
These users can find the work items not in "My work items", but in "Items claimable by me" menu.

. *Separate work item is created for each member of the "group".* These users are added to the list of approvers for the given approval schema stage.
Approval schema stage evaluation strategy (all must approve, first decides) is then applied to the complete list of approvers.

[NOTE]
====
In midPoint 3.5, only orgs are supported for user grouping.
Also, only the former option (work item per group) is supported.

Starting from midPoint 3.6, both orgs and roles can be used to group users.
Both options are provided.
The `groupExpansion` property is used to select between them; a value of `byClaimingWorkItem` is used for the former and `onWorkItemCreation` for the latter.

----

This is quite self-explanatory.
In this case, we are looking for approvers for this role by gathering users that have assigned the role with a relation of `approver`. If there are no such users, the request is rejected.

We can see the composed approval schema there.
Individual levels are renumbered to a sequence starting at 1. Approver expressions are not resolved yet; neither are "group" members (Security Approvers in this case).
All of these actions are done when the particular level is executed.

For example, when first level is started, the following is output:

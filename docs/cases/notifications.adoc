The category can be used to filter events e.g. using `<category>` event filter.
The operation can be used to filter events e.g. using `<operation>` event filter.

The hierarchy of event categories is the following:

* `workflowEvent`
** `workflowProcessEvent`
** `workItemEvent`
*** `workItemLifecycleEvent`
*** `workItemAllocationEvent`
*** `workItemCustomEvent`

So, for example, each `workItemAllocationEvent` is also a `workItemEvent` and `workflowEvent`.

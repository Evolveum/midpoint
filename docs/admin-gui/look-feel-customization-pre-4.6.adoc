Current MidPoint theme is based on link:https://almsaeedstudio.com/preview[AdminLTE] template.
AdminLTE uses:

* Bootstrap 3

* jQuery 2.11

* other plugins

We're also using:

* link:https://ace.c9.io/#nav=about[Ace editor]

* select and multiselect combo boxes for bootstrap


== Quick customization tips


=== AdminLTE skins

Template contains 12 predefined skins:

* skin-blue

* skin-blue-light

* skin-yellow

* skin-yellow-light

* skin-green

* skin-green-light

* skin-purple

* skin-purple-light

* skin-red

* skin-red-light

* skin-black

* skin-black-light

To change skin you have to modify `PageTemplate.html` which you can find in module `admin-gui/src/main/java/com/evolveum/midpoint/web/page/PageTemplate.html`. You can also change it in `war` if you prefer to customize GA release.

[source,xml]
----
<link href="../../../../../webjars/adminlte/2.3.0/dist/css/skins/skin-blue-light.min.css" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" />
----

and

[source,xml]
----
<body class="skin-blue-light">
----


=== Changing template header and logo

To change template header color and logo you have to edit file midpoint-theme.less which is located in module in `admin-gui/src/main/webapp/less/midpoint-theme.less`. You can also change it in war if you prefer to customize GA release.

[source,css]
----
.skin-blue-light .main-header {
  & .logo {
    //background-color: red;	//this will change color under logo image

    &:hover {
      //background-color: red;  //this will change color under logo image during hover event
    }

    & > span {
      height: 100%;
      width: 100%;
      display: inline-block;
      background: url("../img/midpoint_logo_white_180.png") no-repeat 10px 3px;	//here you can put logo of your company
    }
  }

  & nav.navbar.navbar-static-top {
    //background-color: red;	//this will change color of navigation bar on top of page
  }
}

== Stylesheets without overlay

++++
{% include since.html since="3.7" %}
++++


It is possible to add file named `midpoint.less` to `midpoint.home` folder.
This file will be used during less compilation (during runtime) and styles will be appended to the end of `midpoint-theme.css` so it can be used to override existing CSS styles without need to build maven overlay project.


== Stylesheet files description

All style sheets are compiled from LESS files located in `admin-gui/src/main/webapp/less/...` based on `wro4j.xml` definitions.
Most interesting files for review/change when updating styles in MidPoint are:

* admin-lte/bootstrap-less/variables.less

* admin-lte/less/variables.less

* midpoint-theme-variables.less

* midpoint-theme.less

Best way to change them is using xref:/midpoint/reference/deployment/maven-overlay-project/[maven overlay] project.


== Javascript files description

Javascript files are located in `admin-gui/src/main/webapp/js/...` . Most of the MidPoint specific code is located in `midpoint-theme.js`.

Resource Wizard lets you easily create and update resource configuration.
You don't need to know midPoint XML language, the configuration is entirely UI-based.
The resource wizard takes the form of screens with choices for specific parts of resource configuration.

There are multiple resource wizards ready to help you with various configurations related to your resources:

* xref:./create-resource-using-wizard[Create a new resource]
* xref:../resource-wizard/object-type[Configure resource object types]
* xref:../resource-wizard/association-type[Define object type relations for group membership]

//Resource wizard was completely rewritten and redesigned in midPoint version 4.6.
//It was further enhanced in midPoint 4.8.

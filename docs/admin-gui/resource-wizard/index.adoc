Resource wizards let you create and update resource configurations.
You don't need to know midPoint XML language, the wizards are entirely GUI-based.
Resource wizards take a form of screens with choices for specific parts of resource configuration.

There are multiple resource wizards ready to help you with various configurations related to your resources:

* xref:./create-resource-using-wizard[Create a new resource]
* xref:../resource-wizard/object-type[Configure resource object types]
* xref:../resource-wizard/association-type[Define object type relations for group membership]

//Resource wizard was completely rewritten and redesigned in midPoint version 4.6.
//It was further enhanced in midPoint 4.8.

== Limitations

Resource wizard has several limitations as of midPoint 4.8, such as:

* expression editor supports `As is`, `Script`, `Literal` and `Generate` expressions only
* xref:/midpoint/reference/expressions/mappings/range/[mapping ranges] are not supported
* xref:/midpoint/reference/expressions/mappings/#mapping-domain[mapping domains] are not supported
* correlation configuration currently supports only xref:/midpoint/reference/correlation/items-correlator/[]

midPoint resource wizard won't be able to show or allow editing of these features but should tolerate them and keep them in the configuration.

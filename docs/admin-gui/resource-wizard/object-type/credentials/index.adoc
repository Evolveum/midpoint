Manage credentials on your resources in the graphical user interface using the resource wizard for credential mappings.

In midPoint, you can manage various types of credentials, such as passwords, link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Shell#Authentication:_OpenSSH_key_management[SSH keys], link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X.509[X.509] certificates for link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security[TLS], link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time-based_one-time_password[TOTPs] for link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-factor_authentication[MFA], etc.
You can configure credential mappings to transfer credentials between the resource and midPoint, generate new keys that follow your security policies, or run a script to perform any advanced actions on the credentials.

The resource wizard for credential mappings is similar to the xref:/midpoint/reference/admin-gui/resource-wizard/object-type/activation/[wizard used for activation configuration].
However, it is generally simpler and does not offer any presets.

[NOTE]
====
You do not need any credential mappings if you do not manage credentials on the resource.
That may be, for instance, when you handle authentication by SSO using a separate system.

== Add credential mappings

To define credential mappings in the GUI:

. In [.nowrap]#icon:database[] *Resources*# > [.nowrap]#icon:database[] *All resources*#, go to your resource.
. In [.nowrap]#icon:male[] *Accounts*#, click [.nowrap]#icon:cog[] btn:[Configure]# > [.nowrap]#icon:key[] *Credentials*#.
. Select [.nowrap]#icon:arrow-right-to-bracket[] *Inbound*# or [.nowrap]#icon:arrow-right-from-bracket[] *Outbound*# tab:
    ** Inbound: To send credentials to midPoint
    ** Outbound: To send credentials to the resource
. Click [.nowrap]#icon:circle-plus[] btn:[Add inbound]# (or outbound) to add new mapping rule.
. Click [.nowrap]#icon:gear[] btn:[Settings]# on the new tile that appears in the selected tab.

=== Define basic options

At this point, what you do next highly depends on what your goal is.
Here is an outline of your options:

* *Name* the mapping descriptively.
    ** The requirements are identical to those for other mappings:
        In general, it is optimal to treat mapping names the same as file names.
        They need to be unique and it is best to use hyphens instead of spaces.
* Set *strength* based on the mapping purpose. See the xref:/midpoint/reference/admin-gui/resource-wizard/object-type/mapping/advanced-mappings/#mapping-strength[explanation of the mapping strength options].
* In *Expression*, you define how to handle the credential.
    ** _As is_ is the simplest option that just passes an existing value from midPoint to the resource or vice versa.
    ** _Generate_ tells midPoint to create a new random password.
        This is typically used with the _weak_ strength for initial passwords.
    ** _Literal_ inserts a static value.
    ** _Script_ lets you do almost any magic you wish.
// TODO: Find out some use case for scripts in credential mappings

In some cases, you may need to also specify the following:

* The *Source* attribute of the value.
    ** As a general rule, define source in credential mappings only when the connector does not implicitly handle the password attribute.
        Otherwise, rely on the connector's default behavior.
    ** Typically, you can leave this option blank.
        When using a connector for a resource like LDAP, the connector knows where credentials belong.
        Similar to the resource side, midPoint knows where to look for passwords in focal objects.
    ** However, in case you exchange passwords with a custom resource or one like the xref:/connectors/connectors/com.evolveum.polygon.connector.csv.CsvConnector/[CSV connector],
        you need to tell midPoint (and the connector, by extension) which column is for credentials.
* The *Target* attribute for the value.
// TODO: This may be inaccurate. I have to confirm it.
    ** This option is available only for the inbound credential mapping.
        You can select an atribute of your focal objects to which you wish place the credential value.

When you are done with the basic setup, click btn:[Next: Optional].

=== Adjust advanced settings

On the screen that follows, define the parameters below as needed.
You can safely leave them at defaults and click [.nowrap]#icon:check[] btn:[Done]# to save the mapping and exit the wizard.

* *Authoritative* option defines whether the mapping "tolerates" changes by other means.
    ** Refer to xref:/midpoint/reference/expressions/mappings/#authoritative[Mappings (authoritative)] for details.
* *Exclusive* option ensures only one mapping can target the particular attribute.
    ** Refer to xref:/midpoint/reference/expressions/mappings/#exclusive[Mappings (exclusive)] for details.
* *Channel* option provides a way to restrict the mapping applicability only to the context of certain channels.
    ** Refer to xref:/midpoint/reference/expressions/mappings/#channel-constraints[Mappings (channel constraints)] for details.

When you are done with the setup, click [.nowrap]#icon:check[] btn:[Done]#.

[TIP]
====
New credential mappings are in the _Active_ lifecycle state by default.
We suggest you change it to _Proposed_ and xref:/midpoint/reference/admin-gui/resource-wizard/wizard-existing-resource/#simulated-tasks[test your configuration] first.

== Example configurations

Here are a few example configurations you can use as starting points for your configuration.

=== Generate initial password

Let us have a target resource to which you provision accounts as they are creates in a source resource.
Some systems, such as LDAP, do not allow _passwordless_ accounts, meaning you have to create _some_ password,
even if users need to reset it by means of a help desk, for instance, before actually using the account.

This is the situation to have midPoint generate a random password for new accounts.

. Create a new *outbound* credential mapping.
. *Name* it _generate-initial-password_, for instance.
. Give it a _weak_ *strength*.
. Set the *expression* option to _Generate_.
. Save the mapping.

This mapping populates the password attribute with a random generated password only if the attribute is empty.
Under all other circumstances, the mapping does not change the password because you set it as _weak_.

=== Let users change their password from midPoint

To let users change their resource password in midPoint,
add an outbound credential mapping that takes the password from the corresponding focus in midPoint
and updates it in the resource shadow (and the remote resource, by extension) during reconciliation.
Additionally, you may want to prevent midPoint from overwriting the password, should the user change it by other means—e.g., directly on the resource.

. Create a new *outbound* credential mapping.
. *Name* it _change-password_, for instance.
. Give it a _normal_ *strength*.
. Set the *expression* to _As is_.
. Save the mapping.

The strength of this mapping dictates that it updates the target value when the source changes,
but leaves it be in case the source stays the same but the target value is updated to other value.
The _As is_ expression simply copies the password from midPoint to the resource.

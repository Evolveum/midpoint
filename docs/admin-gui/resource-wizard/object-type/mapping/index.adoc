Mapping is a mechanism that takes input properties from the source, transforms them, and inserts the result into another property that is then used by a resource.
In other words, mapping enables you to use the data from your source systems, such as HR applications, and adapt them so that you can use them in your target systems, such as LDAP.

To access mappings, click icon:database[] *Resources* > icon:database[] *All resources* > *your_resource* > icon:male[] *Accounts* > icon:cog[] *Configure* > icon:retweet[] *Mappings*.

Mappings are composed of two complementary parts:

* *<<inbound_mappings,Inbound mappings>>*: Control the transfer of data from source systems to midPoint objects.
* *<<outbound_mappings,Outbound mappings>>*: Control the transfer of data from midPoint objects to target systems.

For a more in-depth description, see the following pages:

* xref:/midpoint/reference/resources/resource-configuration/schema-handling/[]
* xref:/midpoint/reference/expressions/mappings/[]
* xref:/midpoint/reference/expressions/[]

[[inbound_mappings]]
== Inbound Mappings
Inbound mapping transforms data from authoritative sources to midPoint. Typically, it is used to populate new user objects with data from an HR system.
Refer to xref:/midpoint/reference/expressions/mappings/inbound-mapping/[] for more details.

image::step-2-mappings-inbound.png[link=step-2-mappings-inbound.png, 100%, title=Table of inbound mappings]

To add a new inbound mapping:

. Click icon:circle-plus[] btn:[Add inbound].
. Configure the following: +
    * *Name*: Name of the mapping. This is convenient during troubleshooting and when using xref:/midpoint/reference/resources/resource-configuration/inheritance/[resource template inheritance].
    * *From resource attribute*: Defines a resource attribute that is used as input for the mapping.
    * *Expression*: Specifies how the source attribute is used. + 
    Refer to xref:/midpoint/reference/master/expressions/expressions/#expression-evaluators[] for more details.
        ** _As is_ (default): Copies values from the resource attribute to the midPoint target property.
        ** _Literal_: Allows you to specify a constant value upon clicking btn:[Show values].
        ** _Script_: Allows you to define a more complex behavior using a xref:/midpoint/reference/expressions/expressions/[midPoint expression] (by default in Groovy) upon clicking btn:[Show script].
        ** _Generate_: Allows you to generate a random string using a xref:/midpoint/reference/security/credentials/password-policy/#value-policy[value policy].
        This is typically used for generating passwords. Upon clicking btn:[Show generate], you can choose from the following options in the Mode menu:
            *** _Policy_: Selects a value policy that controls the password generation.
            *** _Universal Unique Identifier_: Generates passwords in the form of a Universal Unique Identifier (UUID).
            This is useful when you need passwords that are guaranteed to be unique and not easily guessable.
        ** _Path_: Specifies a data path to a specific attribute or property in the resource object upon clicking btn:[Show path].
        For example, if you want to create an inbound mapping for an attribute like `fullname`, and you want to derive it from the `givenName` and `familyName` attributes, you can set the path to `givenName + ' ' + familyName`.
    * *Target*: Defines the midPoint property used to store the value generated by the inbound mapping.
    * *Lifecycle state*: Defines the xref:/midpoint/reference/concepts/object-lifecycle/[lifecycle state] of the mapping.
    This can be used for xref:/midpoint/reference/admin-gui/simulations/[Simulations].
    For example, if you set the lifecycle state to `Proposed`, it will only be used to simulate the mapping without influencing the real data.
    Alternatively, setting the lifecycle state to `Draft` disables the mapping, etc.
. Click icon:check[] btn:[Save mappings]

You can delete a mapping by clicking the btn:[Delete] button.

Click icon:[shuffle] btn:[Attribute overrides] if you need to <<attribute_override,override attribute>> visibility or other behavior.

[[advanced_mappings]]
=== Advanced Inbound Mappings
In addition to the standard inbound mapping settings, you can also use a more detailed advanced configuration.

[#use_inbound_for_correlation]
. For an existing inbound mapping, click the icon:edit[] btn:[Edit] button, and configure:

    * *Strength*: Defines how aggressively the mapping is applied:
        ** _Strong_: Always enforces source values.
        For single-value attributes, the source value replaces the target value, while for multi-value attributes, source values are added to target values.
        ** _Normal_: Applies source values only if they have changed (not during reconciliation).
        If the target was modified manually, then the source value does not overwrite the target value.
        ** _Weak_: Applies the source value only if the target has no value.
    * *Use for*: Defines operations in which the mapping is applied.
    This enables you to define different mappings for different contexts.
    For example, when fetching user numbers from a resource, you may want to match them exactly during correlation, however, during synchronization, you may want to normalize them (e.g. strip prefixes).
        ** _Synchronization_: Uses the mapping for xref:/midpoint/reference/admin-gui/resource-wizard/object-type/synchronization/[synchronization], e.g. during initial import, reconciliation, or live synchronization.
        ** _Correlation_: Uses the mapping for xref:/midpoint/reference/admin-gui/resource-wizard/object-type/correlation/[correlation].
        See xref:/midpoint/reference/correlation/#example-4-correlation-for-outbound-resources[an example of inbound mapping defined for correlation] when an item correlator is used, even for target resources where you typically have no inbound mappings.
        ** _All_: Uses the mapping during both synchronization and correlation.
    * *Source*: Defines a midPoint property that is used as input for the mapping.
    This complements the source property defined in *From resource attribute*, and provides you with more room for writing custom scripts by extending the range of usable objects also to midPoint properties.
    * *Condition*: Allows you to control the mapping usage dynamically with a custom script in which you can define a specific xref:/midpoint/reference/expressions/mappings/condition/[condition].
    The mapping is used if the condition evaluates to `true`.
    For example, you may want to apply your mapping only if a user has a specific role or status.
. Click btn:[Next: Optional] and configure:

    * *Authoritative*: Controls how mapping treats changes in source values:
        ** _True_: Always updates the target values with the source values, if they are different.
        This is typically used when there is only one source and you want your target values to always be up-to-date.
        ** _False_: Does not update non-empty target values when source values change.
        Use this option if you have multiple sources, or if you want to retain custom changes of your target values.
    * *Exclusive*: Defines how many mappings a target property can have:
        ** _True_: Treats the mapping as exclusive to the selected target property.
        Using the same target property in a different mapping would trigger an error.
        ** _False_: Allows you to use the selected target property also in other mappings (default).
    * *Channel*: Limits the mapping to a specific xref:/midpoint/reference/concepts/channel.adoc[channel] in which it is applied.
    If no channels are entered, the mapping is applied for all channels.
    * *Except channel*: Defines a channel to which the mapping is not applied.
. Click icon:check[] btn:[Done] to save the changes.

NOTE: The _Undefined_ option that is available in various settings applies the default defined in the xref:/midpoint/reference/resources/resource-schema[Resource Schema XSD].

[[outbound_mappings]]
== Outbound Mappings

Outbound mappings are used to populate target resource attribute values by midPoint properties.
Refer to xref:/midpoint/reference/expressions/mappings/outbound-mapping/[] for more details.

image::step-2-mappings-outbound.png[link=step-2-mappings-outbound.png, 100%, title=Table of outbound mappings]

To add and outbound mapping:

. Click btn:[Add outbound].
. Configure the individual settings.
The available settings are the same as for <<inbound_mappings,inbound mappings>>.
The difference is that while inbound mappings control data transfer between source systems and midPoint, outbound mappings control data transfer from midPoint to target systems, such as LDAP.
. Click icon:check[] btn:[Save mappings]

TIP: You can test new mappings without influencing the real data by setting their *Lifecycle state* to _Proposed_ and use xref:/midpoint/reference/admin-gui/simulations/[Simulations].

Click icon:[shuffle] btn:[Attribute overrides] if you need to <<attribute_override,override attribute>> visibility or other behavior.


[[attribute_override]]
== Attribute Override

Attribute configuration can be overridden beyond the context of the mappings to give you more maneuvering space, for example to override the default connector behavior.
For more details on attributes, see the xref:/midpoint/reference/resources/resource-configuration/schema-handling/attributes/[] page.

image::step-2-mappings-override.png[link=step-2-mappings-override.png, 100%, title=Table of attribute overrides]

. On the inbound/outbound mappings page, click icon:[shuffle] btn:[Attribute overrides].
You can then override the following attribute parameters:

    * *Ref*: Specifies the path to the attribute.
The path must point to an object property or to an attribute in the resource schema that belongs to the respective object class.
    * *Display name*: Defines the display name of the attribute.
    * *Description*: Defines the description of the attribute.
    * *Mandatory field*: Defines if the attribute is mandatory (_True_) or not (_False_).
    * *Multi-value*: Defines if the attribute can contain multiple values (_True_) or only a single value (_False_).
    * *Tolerant*: Defines how different values are tolerated.
    If set to _True_, values set outside of midPoint, or outside the object template mappings, are allowed.
    In such a case, synchronization only removes values that are assigned by midPoint or template mappings, while other values that exist in the resource but are not assigned or provisioned by midPoint are tolerated.
    If set to _False_, these other values are not tolerated.
    When midPoint detects them, e.g. during a reconciliation, it removes them.
    * *Lifecycle state*: Defines the xref:/midpoint/reference/concepts/object-lifecycle/[lifecycle state] of the attribute.
. Click icon:check[] btn:[Save overrides] to save your changes.

[[advanced_attribute_override]]
=== Advanced Attribute Override

In addition to the standard attribute override settings, you can also use a more detailed advanced configuration:

. For an existing override, click the icon:edit[] btn:[Edit] button.
. On the Main configuration page, configure:

    * *Help*: Defines the help text displayed via a tooltip icon whenever the attribute appears in midPoint, such as the user details screen for standard attributes like given name.
    * *Exclusive strong*: Defines how multi-value attributes are treated in the mapping.
        ** _True_: If the attribute contains at least one strong value, only strong values are used. If there are no strong values, normal values are used.
        ** _False_: Both strong and normal values are merged to produce the final set of values.
    * *Read replace mode*: Helps you workaround the connector behavior in case the add, delete, and replace operations are processed in a non-standard manner.
    For example, when a connector treats a replace operation as a merge operation instead, i.e. when it adds a new value but does not remove the old value.
        ** _True_: Modifications to the attribute are executed only as a REPLACE operation.
        This means that if an ADD or DELETE VALUE operation is requested, midPoint fetches the object state, computes the expected result, and writes it to the resource object using a REPLACE VALUE operation.
        ** _False_: The REPLACE operation is not forced.
    * *Fetch strategy*: Defines when and how midPoint fetches the attribute:
        ** _Implicit_: MidPoint expects that the attribute is implicitly returned by the connector in each fetch request (default).
        ** _Explicit_: MidPoint requests the attribute in each fetch request.
        Use this for attributes that the connector does not return by default but which you want to see in midPoint.
        ** _Minimal_: Fetches the attribute only if it is necessary.
        Use this for values that may cause performance overhead, such as lists of members of large groups, or large binary attributes.
    * *Matching rule*: Selects a matching rule that compares attribute values.
    As the default matching rule is a case-sensitive literal comparison, this can be used to prevent unnecessary updating of values in resources that are case-insensitive.
    * *Volatility incoming operation*: Defines for which operation (_Add_, _Modify_, or _Delete_) the attribute can change in midPoint without an explicit request from midPoint.
    This happens when there is different attribute on which this attribute depends.
    For example, if you construct email addresses from user names in midPoint, you can use this option to tell midPoint to expect a change in the email address attribute when a user name change occurs.
    * *Volatility outgoing operation*: Defines for which operation (_Add_, _Modify_, or _Delete_) a change in a midPoint attribute can cause a change in an attribute outside of midPoint.
. Click btn:[Next: Limitations] and on the Limitations page configure:

    * *Read*/*Add*/*Modify*: When set to _False_, disables the respective operation for the attribute.
    You can use these restrictions for example to prevent data corruption when working with a resource that may contain invalid data.
    By default (_Undefined_), these operations are allowed.
    * *Min/Max occurs*: Defines if the attribute is mandatory, and if it is single/multi-valued by overriding the resource schema definition of xref:/midpoint/reference/resources/resource-schema/index.adoc#object-class[minOccurs and maxOccurs].
    * *Processing*: Specifies the depth of processing:
        ** _Ignore_: The attribute is not processed at all.
        ** _Minimal_: The attribute basic data structure is maintained and the attribute values can be logged.
        You can process the attribute and the underlying data structure using a custom code.
        However, all built-in automatic processing, presentation, transformation, or any similar processing is skipped.
. Click icon:check[] btn:[Done] to save the configuration.

NOTE: The _Undefined_ option that is available in various settings applies the default defined in the xref:/midpoint/reference/resources/resource-schema[Resource Schema XSD].

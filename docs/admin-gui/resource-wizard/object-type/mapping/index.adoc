= Resource wizard: Object type mappings
:page-nav-title: Mappings
:page-toc: top
:page-since: "4.9"

This part of object type wizard allows you to define attribute xref:/midpoint/reference/expressions/mappings/[mappings].
This way you can define midPoint behavior for resource attributes: how the resource attributes values should be fetched to midPoint (xref:/midpoint/reference/expressions/mappings/inbound-mapping/[inbound mappings]) or how the resource attribute values should be populated in resource (xref:/midpoint/reference/expressions/mappings/outbound-mapping/[outbound mappings]).

Click either *Inbound mappings* or *Outbound mappings* header in the table of mappings.

.See also the following pages for more information:
* xref:/midpoint/reference/resources/resource-configuration/schema-handling/[Resource Schema Handling]
* xref:/midpoint/reference/expressions/mappings/[Mappings]
* xref:/midpoint/reference/expressions/[MidPoint Expressions and Mappings]
* xref:/midpoint/reference/expressions/mappings/inbound-mapping/[Inbound mappings]
* xref:/midpoint/reference/expressions/mappings/outbound-mapping/[Outbound mappings]

== Inbound mappings

Use xref:/midpoint/reference/expressions/mappings/inbound-mapping/[inbound mappings] to store resource attribute values in midPoint properties.

Click btn:[Add inbound] to add a new inbound mapping.

To define a mapping, you need to configure:

* *Name* of the mapping. This is technically not mandatory, but helps a lot during troubleshooting and when using resource template inheritance.
* *From resource attribute* allows you to type (with autocompletion) the resource attribute that should be used as a source of the mapping.
* *Expression* specifies how the source attribute(s) should be used. Resource wizard support the following xref:/midpoint/reference/expressions/expressions/[expression types]:
** *As is* (default) simply copies the value from resource attribute to midPoint target property
** *Literal* allows to specify a constant value
** *Script* allows to write a more complex behavior using a xref:/midpoint/reference/expressions/expressions/[midPoint expression] (by default in Groovy language)
** *Generate* allows to generate a random string using a value policy (useful for generating passwords)
* *Target* allows you to type (with autocompletion) the midPoint property that should be used to store the value generated by the inbound mapping
* *Lifecycle state* allows you to define the lifecycle state of the mapping. This can be used during xref:/midpoint/reference/admin-gui/simulations/[Simulations], e.g. specifying lifecycle state as `Proposed` will be used only to simulate the mapping, `Draft` disables the mapping etc.

TIP: Adding new mappings to existing configuration can utilize simulations if you use `Proposed` as the new mappings' lifecycle state. Such mappings can be simulated without influencing the real data.

More complex configuration is possible by clicking btn:[Edit] button:

|===

[#use_inbound_for_correlation]
You can define the inbound mapping as ordinary (default), or you can specify *Use for* parameter with value `Correlation` in the *Optional configuration* of the mapping to use the mapping only during the correlation.
This is how you can define inbound mappings to be used in <<Correlation>> when item correlator is used, even for target resources where you normally have no inbound mappings at all.
For more information, please refer to xref:/midpoint/reference/correlation/#example-4-correlation-for-outbound-resources[this example for correlation-only inbound mapping].

Mapping can be deleted by clicking btn:[Delete] button.

Mappings can be saved by clicking btn:[Save mappings] and wizard will return to the previous page from which you started mapping editor.

Click btn:[Attribute overrides] if you need to xref:/midpoint/reference/resources/resource-configuration/schema-handling/#attribute-definitions[override attribute(s) visibility or other behavior].

== Outbound Mappings

Use xref:/midpoint/reference/expressions/mappings/outbound-mapping/[outbound mappings] to populate resource attribute values from midPoint properties.

Click btn:[Add outbound] to add a new outbound mapping.

To define a mapping, you need to configure:

* *Name* of the mapping. This is technically not mandatory, but helps a lot during troubleshooting and when using resource template inheritance.
* *Source* allows you to type (with autocompletion) the midPoint property that should be used as a source for this outbound mapping
+
TIP: Even multiple source attributes can be defined for an outbound mapping.
* *Expression* specifies how the source attribute(s) should be used. Resource wizard support the following xref:/midpoint/reference/expressions/expressions/[expression types]:
** *As is* (default) simply copies the value from resource attribute to midPoint target property
** *Literal* allows to specify a constant value
** *Script* allows to write a more complex behavior using a xref:/midpoint/reference/expressions/expressions/[midPoint expression] (by default in Groovy language)
** *Generate* allows to generate a random string using a value policy (useful for generating passwords)
* *To resource attribute* allows you to type (with autocompletion) the resource attribute that should be used as a target of the mapping.
* *Lifecycle state* allows you to define the lifecycle state of the mapping. This can be used during xref:/midpoint/reference/admin-gui/simulations/[Simulations], e.g. specifying lifecycle state as `Proposed` will be used only to simulate the mapping, `Draft` disables the mapping etc.

Mapping can be deleted by clicking btn:[Delete] button.

Mappings can be saved by clicking btn:[Save mappings] and wizard will return to the previous page from which you started mapping editor.

Click btn:[Attribute overrides] if you need to xref:/midpoint/reference/resources/resource-configuration/schema-handling/#attribute-definitions[override attribute(s) visibility or other behavior].

== Attribute override

Attribute configuration can be xref:/midpoint/reference/resources/resource-configuration/schema-handling/#attribute-definitions[overridden] beyond the context of the mappings.
This is useful to override attribute visibility, its display name, tolerance etc.

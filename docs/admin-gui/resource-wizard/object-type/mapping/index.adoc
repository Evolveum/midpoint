:page-description: Configure mappings to define how midPoint manages and transforms data you need to exchange among various systems connected to it.

Mapping is a mechanism that takes input properties from a source, transforms them, and inserts the result into a target property.
In other words, mappings are your means of data transformation and exchange among various systems you have connected to midPoint.

Refer to xref:/midpoint/reference/expressions/[] for more details on the topic.

[[inbound_mappings]]
[[outbound_mappings]]
== Inbound vs. outbound mappings

There are two complementary kinds of mapping rules, inbound and outbound.

*Inbound mappings* transfer data from xref:/midpoint/reference/schema/focus-and-projections/[projections] (e.g., accounts) on the resource side to xref:/midpoint/reference/schema/focus-and-projections/[focal objects] (e.g., users) on the midPoint side.
They map data in the direction which points _into_ midPoint.
For example, you can use inbound mappings to populate midPoint user attributes with data from your remote application, such as an HR system.

*Outbound mappings* define how to populate the resource-side object attributes with the values from focal object attributes in midPoint.
They map data in the direction which points _out of_ midPoint.

In mapping rules of either direction, you need to define:

* A *name* which should be descriptive and has to be unique across the whole midPoint xref:/glossary/#resource[resource].
* A *source* attribute, the value of which serves as the input for the mapping rule.
* A *target* attribute to which the mapping sends its output.
* An *expression* declaring how to handle the input value.
* A *lifecycle state*.

For inbound mappings, the source is an attribute in the resource and the target is a focus attribute in midPoint.
Conversely, for outbound mappings, the source is in midPoint and target is in the resource.

== Configure mapping rules

To configure mappings in a midPoint resource:

. In icon:database[] *Resources* > icon:database[] *All Resources*, select your resource.
. In icon:male[] *Accounts*, click icon:cog[] btn:[Configure] > icon:retweet[] *Mappings*.

.Configuration menu in the resource account list as an entry point to the mapping rules wizard
image::mapping-rules-setup-entry-point-via-accounts-configure-menu.webp["Configuration menu in the resource account list as an entry point to the mapping rules wizard"]

The mapping configuration screen contains two tabs:

* [.nowrap]#icon:arrow-right-to-bracket[] *Inbound mappings (to midPoint)*#
* [.nowrap]#icon:arrow-right-from-bracket[] *Outbound mappings (to resource)*#

.A list of configured inbound mappings
image::step-2-mappings-inbound.png["A screen listing all inbound mappings"]

Select a tab according to which direction you need to configure,
click [.nowrap]#icon:circle-plus[] btn:[Add inbound]# or [.nowrap]#icon:circle-plus[] btn:[Add outbound]#,
and configure the mapping:

* *Name*: Name your mapping descriptively.
    This is convenient during troubleshooting and when using xref:/midpoint/reference/resources/resource-configuration/inheritance/[resource template inheritance].
* *From resource attribute* (inbound mapping): Select a resource attribute that is used as an input for the mapping.
* *Source* (outbound mapping): Select a midPoint focus attribute to be used as an input for the mapping.
* *Expression*: Select how to handle the source attribute value.
    Refer to xref:/midpoint/reference/expressions/expressions/#expression-evaluators[] for more details.
    ** _As is_ (default): Copy values without changes.
    ** _Literal_: Specify one or more constant values upon clicking btn:[Show values].
    ** _Script_: Define a more complex behavior using a script upon clicking btn:[Show script].
    ** _Generate_: Generate a random string.
        You can use this to generate passwords.
        Click btn:[Show generate] to select the mode:
        *** _Policy_: Generate a password abiding a default or explicitly selected xref:/midpoint/reference/security/credentials/password-policy/[password policy].
        *** _Universal Unique Identifier_: Generate a random unique identifier (UUID).
// The UUID mode does not take any policy, selected or not, into account. The related schema docs: https://github.com/Evolveum/midpoint/blob/a6d3e857d2f989822d157f06dce84cc4be55d4b3/infra/schema/src/main/resources/xml/ns/public/common/common-core-3.xsd#L6525 @dakle 2026-01-13
    ** _Path_: Reference a property or a variable upon clicking btn:[Show path].
* *Target* (inbound mapping): Select a midPoint property in which to store the mapping output.
* *To resource attribute* (outbound mapping): Select a resource property in which to store the mapping output.
* *Lifecycle state*: Select the xref:/midpoint/reference/concepts/object-lifecycle/[lifecycle state] of the mapping.

Click icon:check[] btn:[Save mappings] to save your configuration.

[TIP]
====
Use the buttons at the far right of the mapping list rows to delete, rename, or duplicate rules, and to access xref:/midpoint/reference/admin-gui/resource-wizard/object-type/mapping/advanced-mappings/[advanced mapping configuration].

[[attribute_override]]
== Attribute overrides

Attribute configuration can be overridden beyond the context of the mappings to give you more maneuvering space, for example to override the default connector behavior.
Attribute overrides apply to any use of the overridden attributes;
you cannot override an attribute only for outbound mappings, for instance.

Refer to xref:/midpoint/reference/resources/resource-configuration/schema-handling/attributes/[] and the nested articles for details.

To configure attribute overrides:

. In icon:database[] *Resources* > icon:database[] *All Resources*, select your resource.
. In icon:male[] *Accounts*, click icon:cog[] btn:[Configure] > icon:retweet[] *Mappings*.
. Click [.nowrap]#icon:shuffle[] btn:[Attribute overrides]#
. To add a new override, click [.nowrap]#icon:circle-plus[] btn:[Add override]#.

[NOTE]
====
By default, all attributes that are or have been used in a mapping rule are listed on the attribute overrides screen.

.List of configured attribute overrides
image::step-2-mappings-override.png["Screen listing configured attribute overrides"]

These are the options you can configure for an attribute override:

* *Ref*: Select the attribute to override.
* *Display name*: Specify the display name of the attribute.
* *Description*: Define the description of the attribute.
* *Mandatory field*: Specify if the attribute is mandatory (_True_) or not (_False_).
* *Multi-value field*: Define if the attribute can contain multiple values (_True_) or only a single value (_False_).
* *Tolerant*: Define whether values of a foreign origin are tolerated.
    ** When an attribute is tolerant, midPoint will _tolerate_ values it has not provisioned itself, e.g., those set directly in the resource.
    ** When an attribute is not tolerant, midPoint will proactively remove during a reconciliation any value that that does not originate from midPoint.
* *Lifecycle state*: Select the xref:/midpoint/reference/concepts/object-lifecycle/[lifecycle state] of the attribute.

Click icon:check[] btn:[Save overrides] to save your changes.

Use the buttons at the far right of the attribute override list rows to delete or duplicate overrides, and to access xref:/midpoint/reference/admin-gui/resource-wizard/object-type/mapping/advanced-mappings/#advanced_attribute_override[advanced attribute override configuration].

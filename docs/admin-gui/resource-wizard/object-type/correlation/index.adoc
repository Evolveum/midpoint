Smart correlation in midPoint is a mechanism that links resource object shadows to existing focal objects, enabling efficient synchronization through a configurable matching system.
In short, it's a means to searching resource object owners in midPoint.

Correlation rules dictate how to find the object owners.
You can define one or more correlation rules.

== Create Correlation Rules

. In icon:database[] *Resources* > icon:database[] *All Resources*, select your resource.
. In icon:male[] *Accounts*, click icon:cog[] btn:[Configure] > icon:code-branch[] *Correlation*.
. Click icon:plus-circle[] btn:[Add rule] and configure the new rule:
    ** *Rule name*:
    ** *Description*:
    ** *Weight*:
    ** *Tier*:
    ** *Ignore if matched by*:
    ** *Enabled*:



Click btn:[Add rule] to add a new correlation rule.

For the correlation, you can configure the following:

* *Rule name* for documentation and troubleshooting purposes
* *Description*
* *Weight*, *Tier*, *Ignore if matched by* for more complex scenarios
* *Enabled* to enable or disable the correlation rule

Click btn:[Edit] button to edit details of the correlation rule.

Specify the item configuration:

* *Item* refers to a midPoint property for which an inbound mapping exists. This will be used for correlation. E.g. if there is an inbound mapping from AD's `sAMAccountName` attribute to midPoint user's `name` property, you would use `name` item
+
TIP: For target resources where inbound mappings are normally not used, the inbound mapping can be in a special <<#use_inbound_for_correlation,"Use for correlation only" mode>>.
* *Search method* allows to specify either exact match or one of the fuzzy search methods supported by midPoint

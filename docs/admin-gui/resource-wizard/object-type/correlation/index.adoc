Correlation allows you to define how midPoint should recognize relations between resource objects and midPoint objects.
In short, this is about searching the resource object owners in midPoint.

You can create one or several correlation rules.

Click btn:[Add rule] to add a new correlation rule.

For the correlation, you can configure the following:

* *Rule name* for documentation and troubleshooting purposes
* *Description*
* *Weight*, *Tier*, *Ignore if matched by* for more complex scenarios
* *Enabled* to enable or disable the correlation rule

Click btn:[Edit] button to edit details of the correlation rule.

Specify the item configuration:

* *Item* refers to a midPoint property for which an inbound mapping exists. This will be used for correlation. E.g. if there is an inbound mapping from AD's `sAMAccountName` attribute to midPoint user's `name` property, you would use `name` item
+
TIP: For target resources where inbound mappings are normally not used, the inbound mapping can be in a special <<#use_inbound_for_correlation,"Use for correlation only" mode>>.
* *Search method* allows to specify either exact match or one of the fuzzy search methods supported by midPoint

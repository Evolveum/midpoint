This page describes how to use object marks in the *Object type policies* section of the midPoint graphical user interface (GUI), thus enabling you to control the behavior of groups of accounts and entitlements through policies.

== Introduction 

In midPoint GUI, you can group accounts and entitlements in resources so that you can apply policies only to such groups.
This is done in the *Object type policies* section of the application, where you can configure the following features:

* <<classify_objects,Marking>> - Groups accounts or entitlements by filtering them and assigning marks to them.
* <<default_operation_policy,Default Operation Policy>> - Defines the default policy for objects that have not been explicitly assigned marks in the <<classify_objects,Marking>> section.

For more technical details on object marks, and to see how you can use them in your workflows, see xref:/midpoint/reference/concepts/mark[].

[[classify_objects]]
== Classify objects using marks
Objects are classified by selecting a mark, and subsequently, defining a xref:/midpoint/reference/concepts/query/midpoint-query-language/[filter] that matches the objects that will be grouped under that mark.

As classification is done using already existing object marks, create them in [.nowrap]#icon:tag[] *Marks*# > [.nowrap]#icon:tag[] *Object marks*#, if you have not already done so.

Once you have all marks created and ready to be used, classify your objects:

. Go to the resource that contains the objects to which you want to apply marks by clicking [.nowrap]#icon:database[] *Resources*# > [.nowrap]#icon:database[] *All resources*# > resource.
. In the resource, depending on which objects you want to group, click [.nowrap]#icon:male[] *Accounts*# or [.nowrap]#icon:users[] *Entitlements*#.
. Click [.nowrap]#icon:cog[] btn:[Configure]# and select [.nowrap]#icon:balance-scale[] *Policies*#.
+

. Click [.nowrap]#icon:tag[] btn:[Marking]#.
. Click [.nowrap]#icon:circle-plus[] btn:[New marking rule]#.
. Select the mark that you want to use for your group of objects.
. In *Application time*, select when the mark should be applied to objects:
    ** *Always* - Anytime that midPoint works with the objects.
    ** *Classification* - Only once when the objects are created in the midPoint repository.
. Click [.nowrap]#icon:edit[] btn:[Edit]# and enter a xref:/midpoint/reference/concepts/query/midpoint-query-language/filters[filter query] that matches the objects you want to group under the selected mark.
. Click btn:[Done].
. Click btn:[Save marking rules] to put the marking policy in effect.
The selected mark will be applied to objects based on how you have configured the *Application time*.


[[default_operation_policy]]
== Define default operation policy
// GUI - "Default operation policy"

Default operation policy applies to objects that are not explicitly marked in the <<classify_objects,Marking>> section of Object type policies.
This enables you to define the default behavior for objects that do not need a specific treatment.
For example, you may want to set the Default operation policy to `Unmanaged` to make all objects of the object type effectively read-only (outbound behavior will be ignored) during object management migration to midPoint.

. Go to the resource that contains the objects to which you want to apply the default operation policy by clicking [.nowrap]#icon:database[] *Resources*# > [.nowrap]#icon:database[] *All resources*# > resource.
. In the resource, depending on the objects for which you want to set up the default operation policy, click [.nowrap]#icon:male[] *Accounts*# or [.nowrap]#icon:users[] *Entitlements*#.
. Click [.nowrap]#icon:cog[] btn:[Configure]# and select [.nowrap]#icon:balance-scale[] *Policies*#.
. Click [.nowrap]#icon:balance-scale[] btn:[Default operation policies]#.
. Click [.nowrap]#icon:circle-plus[] btn:[Add new policy]#.
. In the *Policy* field, select the mark to which your default policy applies. +
To create a new mark, click [.nowrap]#icon:edit[] btn:[Edit]# and select *Create new mark* in the Default operation policy dialog.
This way you can enable/disable the policy for individual operations, such as Add or Modify, and define what the system reports when those operations occur.
. Select the xref:/midpoint/reference/concepts/object-lifecycle/[lifecycle state] for your policy.
. Click btn:[Save policies].

TIP: Use default operation policy in xref:/midpoint/methodology/group-synchronization/[].
For example, set it to `Unmanaged` to automatically consider all resource groups as "inbound-only" objects.

[[mark_manually]]
== Mark objects manually

In addition to marking objects in bulk by filtering them in the <<classify_objects,Marking>> section, you can also mark individual objects manually in the following areas of the midPoint GUI:

* <<accounts,Accounts>>
* <<entitlements,Entitlements>>
* <<simulations,Simulations>>

[[accounts]]
=== Accounts
. Go to [.nowrap]#icon:database[] *Resources*# > [.nowrap]#icon:database[] *All resources*# > resource.
. In the resource, click [.nowrap]#icon:male[] *Accounts*#.
+
image::object-add-mark-01.webp[100%,title=Navigate to accounts]
. Click the name of the account that you want to mark.
. Go to the [.nowrap]#icon:circle[] *Marks*# tab.
+
image::object-add-mark-02.webp[100%,title=Add marks to accounts]
. Click [.nowrap]#icon:plus[] btn:[Add mark]# to add a new mark.

[[entitlements]]
=== Entitlements
. Go to [.nowrap]#icon:database[] *Resources*# > [.nowrap]#icon:database[] *All resources*# > resource.
. In the resource, click [.nowrap]#icon:users[] *Entitlements*#.
. Click the dropdown button at the far right for the entitlement you want to mark and select [.nowrap]#*Modify marks*#.
+
image::object-add-mark-03.webp[100%,title=Add marks to entitlements]
. Click [.nowrap]#icon:plus[] btn:[Add mark]# to add a new mark.

[[simulations]]
=== Simulations
. Go to [.nowrap]#icon:flask[] *Simulations*# > [.nowrap]#icon:circle[] *All results*#.
. Click the name of a simulation.
. Click the [.nowrap]#icon:search[] btn:[View processed objects]# button.
. For the object to which you want to assign marks, you can:
** Mark the object directly as _Protected_ by clicking the [.nowrap]#icon:shield-alt[] btn:[Mark as Protected]# button.
+
image::simulations-add-mark.webp[100%,title=Add marks in simulation results]
** Assign other marks by clicking the dropdown button next to the [.nowrap]#icon:shield-alt[] btn:[Mark as Protected]# button, and selecting *Modify marks*.

== Review marks

You can review marked objects by going to [.nowrap]#icon:tag[] *Marks*# > [.nowrap]#icon:tag[] *Object marks*# > mark > [.nowrap]#icon:circle[] *Marked shadows*#.

This page describes how to configure association types in the resource wizard.

== Introduction

Associations enable you to configure the resource for object type relations.
Typically, this is used to configure how account/group membership is defined and processed.

For more details, refer to the following pages:

* xref:/midpoint/reference/resources/entitlements/#association-definition[Association definition]
* xref:/midpoint/reference/resources/entitlements/[Entitlements]

== Configure association types
// fix the first step
The configuration of association types is done in the resource wizard during the resource creation or modification.

. Access the wizard:
+
* When creating a new resource, click [.nowrap]#icon:code-compare[] btn:[Configure Association Types]#.
* When modifying an existing resource, click:
    ** [.nowrap]#icon:gears[] btn:[Schema handling]# > [.nowrap]#icon:code-compare[] btn:[Association types]#, or
    ** [.nowrap]#icon:male[] btn:[Accounts]# > [.nowrap]#icon:cog[] btn:[Configure]# > [.nowrap]#icon:code-compare[] btn:[Create association]#.
+
This shows you a table that lists association types.

. Click btn:[Add association type] to start configuring a new association type.

. Select an association type, which is predefined by capabilities or the connector, by clicking on it.
+

. After selecting the association, you will see a four-step wizard.
In the first step, configure the basic settings:
+
* *Name* and *Display name* are used for naming purposes.
* *Description* enables you to enter a short description.
* *Lifecycle state* enables you to define the lifecycle state, e.g., `Proposed` for a xref:/midpoint/reference/admin-gui/simulations/[simulation] of the association configuration.

. Click btn:[Next: Subjects] to continue in the association type definition wizard.

. In the second step, select the subject (i.e., an object type of the resource) of the association.
If there is only one option, it will be preselected and you can proceed to the next step.

. Click btn:[Next: Objects] to continue in the association type definition wizard.

. Select the object (i.e., an object type of the resource) of the association.
+

. Click btn:[Next: Data for association] to continue in the association type definition wizard.

. Specify the reference attribute to define the data corresponding to the association, and the association tolerance:
+
* The *Reference attribute* is predefined by default but you can customize it.
For example, instead of `group`, you can use `ldapGroup`.
MidPoint automatically resolves duplicate reference attribute names: if you defined multiple association types, the reference attributes would become `group`, `group1`, etc. by default.
* *tolerant* enables you to specify how midPoint tolerates associations (membership) with objects other than those associated via midPoint.
The default value `Undefined` is the same as `True` and makes midPoint keep the membership even if not defined via midPoint.
`False` removes such associations when the resource object is reprocessed, e.g., during reconciliation.
+
TIP: When in doubt, use `Undefined` or `True`.
+
NOTE: xref:/midpoint/reference/concepts/mark/[] can redefine association (membership) tolerance.
+

. Click btn:[Save settings] to save the association type configuration.

. After creating the new association type, you will see a page with the following options:
+
* *Basic Attributes* tile represents a two-step wizard that you have already seen during the creation of the association type,
enabling you to access the first and the last step without having to select the subject and object of the association.
* *Subject* tile opens the xref:./subject/[Subject wizard].
* *Object* tile returns back to the object selection.

This article contains advanced configuration options for dashboards and dashboard widgets in particular.
You can use the options to select the data sources for your widgets or adjust the appearance of your dashboard widgets,
including conditioning the appearance so that you get a visual warning when there are, for example, users with too many high-privilege roles.

The widget element can contain three configuration elements: `display`,`data`, and `presentation` which you can use to configure what the widget looks like, whence it takes the data, and how it presents the data to users.

include::use-idea-for-midpoint-engineering.adoc[]

== Define data sources for widgets

The `data` element defines the source of the data that the widget displays.

To take off lightly, here is the simplest possible example of a widget with an object collection as its data source:

[source,xml]
----
<widget>
    ...
    <data>
        <sourceType>objectCollection</sourceType>
        <collection>
            <collectionRef oid="15de186e-1d8c-11e9-a469-8f5d9cfc0259" type="c:ObjectCollectionType"/>
        </collection>
    </data>
</widget>
----

The table below contains more details about the configuration options you have regarding the data sources.

.Configuration options for the `data` element
[%autowidth]
|===
| Name | Type | Description

| `sourceType`
| `DashboardWidgetSourceType`
a| Specify the type of input data for generating a message shown in the widget.
    Possible options are:

    * `objectCollection`: Content of the widget is based on an object collection.
    * `auditSearch`: Content of the widget is based on the data from an object collection with a filter for xref:/midpoint/reference/security/audit/[audit records].
        See also xref:/midpoint/reference/misc/reports/examples/audit-report-with-changed-attributes/[].
    * `object`: Content of the widget is based on the data from a single object.
        We describe this using `sourceType` and `displaySourceType` in the example beneath the table.

| `displaySourceType`
| `DashboardWidgetSourceType`
| Use this element in asynchronous widgets to select the data source the widget uses for displaying data.

    For asynchronous widgets, set this to `widgetData`.
    Although the widget data source (`sourceType`) may be, e.g., an object collection,
    a report can save the computed data into the widget object
    and the widget can then display the saved data without querying midPoint objects through the collection anew.

    The widget in the GUI usually contains a btn:[More info] button which takes users to a details page with objects queried using the `sourceType` element configuration.

    Refer to the simple example of `sourceType` and `displaySourceType` elements usage beneath the table.
    See also xref:/midpoint/reference/admin-gui/dashboards/dashboard-configuration-intro/#async-widget[] for a full tutorial on the topic.

| `collection`
| `CollectionRefSpecificationType`
| Specify which object collection should the widget use to query midPoint objects.
    The element contains a `collectionRef` element with a reference to the particular collection.

| `objectRef`
| `ObjectReferenceType`
| Specifies a single object as a data source for the widget.

| `storedData`
| `String`
| Specifies a string as a widget data source.
    The string can be stored by a report task.
    Use this configuration for asynchronous widgets.

|===

.An example of a simple asynchronous widget
[source,xml]
----
<widget>
    ...
    <data>
        <sourceType>objectCollection</sourceType> <!--1-->
        <displaySourceType>widgetData</displaySourceType> <!-2-->
        <collection>
            <collectionRef oid="15de186e-1d8c-11e9-a469-8f5d9cfc0259" type="c:ObjectCollectionType"/> <!--3-->
        </collection>
        <storedData>25/25 runnable</storedData>
    </data>
</widget>
----
<1> The source from which the data for the widget to display are computed.
<2> The instruction for the widget to display the data it has saved in itself. These data have been saved to the widget by a report.
<3> The object collection used as the primary source of the widget data.

You can use an `objectCollection`, `auditSearch` or `object` as a data source for asynchronous widgets.
Regardless the widget data source, for asynchronous widgets, you need to use the `displaySourceType` element with the `widgetData` value.

=== Use specific object as a widget data source

Another option is to define a specific `object` as a source.
In this case, a part of the configuration is a reference to the object which is used as a source.
The configuration contains a path to the attribute which is presented in the widget.

.An example of a widget data source for an object type
[source,xml]
----
<widget>
    <c:identifier>report-task-status</c:identifier>
    <data>
        <sourceType>object</sourceType>
        <objectRef oid="ed05a4ae-e39f-465a-bd56-35c41fb97bd1" type="c:TaskType"/>
    </data>
    <presentation>
        <dataField>
            <fieldType>value</fieldType>
            <expression>
                <c:path xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:type="t:ItemPathType">$object/executionState</c:path>
            </expression>
        </dataField>
    </presentation>
</widget>
----

In the example above, the selected object is a report task.
The path is set to query the execution status of the task.
The widget may render as follows, for example:

.Dashboard widget showing the execution status of an explicitly selected task.
image::object.png["Dashboard widget showing the execution status of task"]

== Define widget visual and presentation attributes

=== Visual configuration

The `display` attribute contains configuration of the widget visual side in the GUI.

.Configuration options for the `display` attribute
[%autowidth]
|===
| Name | Type | Description

| `label`
| `String`
| Displayed name of widget.


| `color`
| `String`
| Default background color of the widget.


| `icon/cssClass`
| `String`
| CSS class for widget icon; e.g., `fa fa-user`.


| `cssStyle`
| `String`
| CSS style for the widget; e.g., `color: #444 !important`.

|===

=== Presentation of widget data

// TODO: add configuration examples to each presentation option @dakle 2025-09-07

`presentation` is a container attribute used to define how to present the data.

There are four presentation options:

* percentage (50%)

image::percentage.png[]

* separated with slash (5/10)

image::slash.png[]

* separated with "of" (5 of 10)

image::of.png[]

* only value (5)

image::only-value.png[]

The `presentation` container contains three attributes: `dataField`, `variation` and `view`.


==== The widget data field

The attribute `dataField` describes the properties of a specific widget data field.
Note that the order in the `dataField` elements is _not_ significant.
The field order is given by specific presentation style.

The attributes for `dataField`:

.Configuration options for the `dataField` attribute
[%autowidth]
|===
| Name | Type | Description

| `fieldType`
| `DashboardWidgetDataFieldType`
| Type of the field.
    MidPoint currently supports `value` and `unit` as the values for the `fieldType` attribute:

    * `value` is the actual value displayed.
    * `unit` defines the unit for the value.

    For example, in a message _5/9 up_ is _5/9_ the `value` and _up_ the `unit`.

| `expression`
| `ExpressionType`
| Expression that produces the value to display in the widget.

|===

For the `fieldType` attribute, when set to `value`, a special type of expression is defined.
In this expression, the attribute `proportional` must be defined along with the attribute `style`.
The attribute `style` is an enumeration type with the following values:

* `percentage` (for example, 50%)
* `value-slash-domain` (for example, 5/10)
* `value-of-domain` (for example, 5 of 10)
* `value-only` (for example, 5)

==== Variation of Widget Data

The next presentation attribute is `variation`.
This attribute allows for conditional variation in how the widget is displayed.
Variations may change the colors or icons of the widget based on specific conditions.
The attributes for `variation` are as follows:

.Configuration attributes to define a widget display variation based on a condition
[%autowidth]
|===
| Name | Type | Description

| `condition`
| `ExpressionType`
| Condition for the variation.
The variation will be active if the condition evaluates to true.


| `display`
| `DisplayType`
| Display properties are applied when the condition evaluates to true.
    These display properties specify only the presentation aspects that differ from the usual presentation.
    For example, if the variation only changes the widget color, only the color needs to be specified here.
    Icons and other styles are taken from the primary widget display properties.

|===

You can use four variables for `condition`:

.Variables on which you can base the variation condition
[%autowidth]
|===
| Name | Type | Description | `sourceType` in data of widget

| `proportional`
| `IntegerStatType`
| Integer stat (statistic) entry.
    This entry contains stat value, together with domain value.
| `objectCollection`, `auditSearch`

| `policySituations`
| `Collection <String>`
| Collection of policy situations.
| `objectCollection`

| `object`
| Based on the displayed object in the widget
| Processed object.
| `object`

| `storedData`
| `String`
| Data stored in the widget.
| `widgetData`

|===

// TODO no example, add ??
==== View

The last variable of the presentation container is `view`.
This variable is also processed when creating reports.
The main reason to configure a view is to customize the reported or presented object collection that the dashboard widget is based on.
The widget object collection can be accessed via the GUI btn:[More info] button.

=== Configuration details for object collections

You can see the basic configuration for `objectCollection` in xref:/midpoint/reference/admin-gui/collections-views/configuration/#object-collection[].
For the dashboard, you can use `policyRule` with `policyThreshold` to define a `policySituation`.
Here is an example of `objectCollection` for a resource that has the status set to "UP":

//TODO check after sampleRef is fully in prod
.*Example Object Collection*
[%collapsible]
====
link:https://github.com/Evolveum/midpoint-samples/blob/master/samples/dashboard/object-collection-resource-up.xml[Git]

sampleRef::samples/dashboard/object-collection-resource-up.xml[]
====

The variable (collection) _domain_ is a set of objects that represents "all the objects" used in a collection.
For example, for a collection of "up resources", the domain is "all resources."
The domain is filtered using the _filter_ to contain only the specific set of objects needed.

In this example, use _policyRule_ with _policySituation_, which can be leveraged in the variation of widget presentation.
When the _policyThreshold_ is met, the _policySituation_ from _policyRule_ triggers the widget variation.
The _policyThreshold_ has two important variables: _lowWaterMark_ and _highWaterMark_.

_lowWaterMark_ is the lower bound of the threshold, representing the lowest value for which the policy rule is activated.
The policy rule will trigger for all values starting from this value up to the _highWaterMark_ (closed interval).
If no _lowWaterMark_ is specified, the policy rule activates for all values up to the _highWaterMark_.
A policy rule with a threshold that does not have any water marks will never activate.

_highWaterMark_ is the upper bound of the threshold, representing the highest value for which the policy rule is activated.
The policy rule will trigger for all values starting from the _lowWaterMark_ up to this value (closed interval).
If no _highWaterMark_ is specified, the policy rule activates for all values greater than or equal to the _highWaterMark_.

Both variables are of the type _WaterMarkType_, which contains the variables _count_ and _percentage_.

=== Simple Example for "Enabled Users Widget"

This section presents a very simple example of an enabled users widget that displays the number of enabled users.

First, create an object collection with a filter for users for which the attribute `activation/effectiveStatus` equals to `enabled`.

//TODO check after sampleRef is fully in prod

Lastly, add the new dashboard to the GUI in system configuration.

After accessing the new dashboard in GUI, you can see your new widget.

.Dashboard widget showing the number of users for which `effectiveStatus` is `enabled`.
image::enabled-users.png["Dashboard widget showing the number of users for which the effective status is enabled"]

[#_asynchronous_widget]
=== Asynchronous widget

To configure an asynchronous widget, use the `displaySourceType` attribute in the widget configuration and set it to `widgetData`.
Set `sourceType` to `objectCollection` to handle redirects to a details page when clicking on the widget details.

Next, configure a dashboard report task to generate and store data in the widget.
Use a dashboard report with the element `storeExportedWidgetData`.

You can use the same collection as in the previous example for enabled users.

//TODO check after sampleRef is fully in prod

Next, create a dashboard.
Add the attribute `displaySourceType` with the value `widgetData`.

//TODO check after sampleRef is fully in prod

.*Example Dashboard Configuration*

====
link:https://github.com/Evolveum/midpoint-samples/blob/master/samples/dashboard/dashboard-asynchronous-widget.xml[Git]

sampleRef::samples/dashboard/dashboard-asynchronous-widget.xml[]
====

Finally, create a report for the dashboard.

//TODO check after sampleRef is fully in prod

.*Example Report Configuration*
[%collapsible]
====
link:https://github.com/Evolveum/midpoint-samples/blob/master/samples/dashboard/report-asynchronous-widget.xml[Git]

sampleRef::samples/dashboard/report-asynchronous-widget.xml[]
====

Now run the report, and midPoint processes the source data for the dashboard.
The resulting data are written to the widget in the dashboard.

include::../raw/file-format.adoc[]

Next time you open the widget in the GUI, midPoint does not need to process the source data;
it shows the saved data present in the widget object.

.Asynchronous widget showing the number of users for which `effectiveStatus` is `enabled`.
image::enabled-users.png["Asynchronous widget showing the number of users for which the effective status is enabled"]

== Dashboard views

A dashboard can provide additional info when users click the btn:[More info] button.
In this case, should you use an `objectCollection` as the data `sourceType`, you would see a table of objects in the collection.
The table can be configured and customized.
This is done via the `view` container.
The screenshot below is from the example dashboard in link:https://github.com/Evolveum/midpoint-samples/tree/master/samples/dashboard[dashboard-system-status.xml]:

.System status dashboard with widgets showing recent errors, the percentage of resources that are up, and the state of a cleanup task.

[NOTE]
====
It makes sense to run the task for an asynchronous widget as a reoccurring task.
Yet there is no way how to pre-configure the task before you actually "run" the report.
Because of this, the only way is to run the report and afterwards modify the task, so it runs periodically.
There is a work package regarding this at bug:MID-9646[]

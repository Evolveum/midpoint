[NOTE]
====
It makes sense to run the task for an asynchronous widget as a recurring task.
Yet there is no way to preconfigure the task before you actually "run" the report.
Because of this, the only way is to run the report and modify the task afterwards, so that it runs periodically.
There is a work package regarding this at bug:MID-9646[].

Compliance dashboard is a pre-configured object (a.k.a. xref:/midpoint/reference/deployment/ninja/command/initial-objects/[initial object]) in midPoint.
The dashboard can be further extended and customized as needed.

== Mechanism

Functionality of compliance dashboard is heavily based on feature:policy-concept[policies], feature:policy-rule[policy rules] and xref:/midpoint/reference/concepts/mark/[marks], as is described at xref:/midpoint/reference/roles-policies/identity-governance-rules/[] page.
Policy rules, stored in xref:/midpoint/reference/schema/policy/[policy objects] are setting the xref:/midpoint/reference/concepts/mark/[marks], which are used by compliance dashboard for compliance reporting.

This section describes the default configuration for the list view panels in midPoint GUI.

List view panels are widely used in the GUI to display lists of entities (e.g. objects or containers).
MidPoint supports default list view panel configuration for:

* *Object collection views* - List view panels presented on the list pages accessible from the left-side menu (e.g. the icon:user[] *All users*, or icon:role[] *All roles* page).

* *Object details pages* - List view panels which are a part of the details page (e.g. icon:assignment[] *Assignments* > icon:role[] *Role* panel on the User details page).

Depending on what part of the GUI you want to configure, default settings can be configured in different parts of the xref:/midpoint/reference/admin-gui/admin-gui-config[Admin GUI Configuration].
The location of the configuration defines the area where the configuration will be applied.
For example, the default settings within the object details set type will be applied to all list view panels which are a part of the details page.
And the default settings defined in the object collection views type will be applied to all collection views in the GUI.

The default configuration settings include:

* `paging` - Intended to be used while querying in the list view panels.
* `pagingOptions` - Defines the set of the available page sizes, i.e. the number of returned items, for the list view panel.
This enables users to select the number of items to be displayed on a page in a drop-down menu, and thus define the length of the page.

The following table describes the possible configuration options.
[%autowidth]

|===
| Property | Mandatory | Type | Description

| `paging`
| NO
| `PagingType`
a| Parameters limiting the number of returned entries, offset, etc.
This is used in web service operations, such as list or search.
The available parameters are:

* `orderBy` - Defines the property by which the results should be sorted.

* `orderDirection` - Defines how items should be sorted.
The valid values are:

    ** `ascending`
    ** `descending`

* `offset` - The index of the first returned entry, starting with zero.
If set to `0`, the resulting list will start with the first entry.
If set to `1`, the resulting set will start with the second entry.
If not set, the value of `0` is assumed.

* `maxSize` - The maximum number of entries returned.
If not specified, unlimited maximum size is assumed.
If configured for a list view, this value is taken as the default page size on the list view panel.
If the configured value is not present in the set of the available page sizes (see `pagingOptions` below), it will be added to this set as one of the options.

| `pagingOptions`
| NO
| `PagingOptionsType`
a| Paging options which can be applied to list view in GUI.
Contains a multi-value element `availablePageSize` which defines the set of available page size values that will be suggested to users on table panels.

|===

The default settings can be overridden or extended in a specific list view configuration.
Single-valued settings can be overridden in a deeper nested configuration, e.g. in a role.
Multi-value settings can be extended, e.g. in a role, by adding new values to the set of the available page sizes.

The settings that are available for the configuration in the `defaultSettings` element are also present in the collection view type.
This means that `paging` and `pagingOptions` can be configured within a specific `objectCollectionView` in object collection views configuration.
Also, these options can be configured within the `listView` element while configuring a specific panel for an object details page.

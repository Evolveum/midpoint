== Customer-Level Organizations

[%autowidth]
|===
| Attribute | Value | Example

| name
| E-mail address of the customer (i.e. email of person that performs the registration).
| link:mailto:jack@sparrow.com[jack@sparrow.com]


| displayName
| User-specified one, if present.
The default is "<user>'s home".
| Jack Sparrow's home


| orgType
| customer
|


| thingSpeakApiKey (extension)
| ThingSpeak API key
| R9TUHWKR8OOQEHWU


| registrationKey (extension)
| Registration key to be entered into devices when configuring them.
It has 16 characters plus a single hyphen in the middle.
| HQ481047-1JWORF43


| registrationLookupKey (extension)
| First half of the registration key.
Used to look up a device and validate its authenticity.
(Second part of the key is used to encrypt the response.)
| HQ481047


| assignment
| The "Customers" root node reference.
So all these organizations are created one level below the root.
|


|===


== Customer's Internal Organizations

The customer is free to create arbitrary organizational structure within his organization.
Names are generated automatically in order to avoid naming collisions.

[%autowidth]
|===
| Attribute | Value | Example

| name
| E-mail address of the customer plus a random number
| link:mailto:jack@sparrow.com[jack@sparrow.com] 832842948324


| displayName
| A name chosen by the customer
| Black Pearl


|===


== Users

[%autowidth]
|===
| Attribute | Value | Example

| name
| User's e-mail address.
| link:mailto:jack@sparrow.com[jack@sparrow.com]


| givenName
| As specified during registration.
| Jack


| familyName
| As specified during registration.
| Sparrow


| fullName
| Derived form given name and family name.
| Jack Sparrow


| emailAddress
| User's e-mail address.
| link:mailto:jack@sparrow.com[jack@sparrow.com]


| assignment
| Customer-level organization.
Assigned as a member as well as a manager of it.
| Jack's World

== Resources

Because of ThingSpeak API structure we need to have a "channels" resource for each ThingSpeak account.
These resources have majority of items the same:

* connectorRef,

* connectorConfiguration (except for password),

* schemaHandling,

* capabilities,

* synchronization.

They are stored in _ThingSpeak (master resource)_ object.
We would need to use Resource template feature (bug:MID-1653[]).
Until it is ready, however, we do a small workaround by creating resource object by simply copying the "master".
Properties specific for each resource copy are:

[%autowidth]
|===
| Attribute | Value | Example

| name
| Resource name: ThingSpeak channels of <email>
| ThingSpeak channels of link:mailto:jack@sparrow.com[jack@sparrow.com]


| connectorConfiguration/configurationProperties/password
| Customer's ThingSpeak account API key
| R9TUHWKR8OOQEHWU


|===

We had to provide a connector implementation for ThingSpeak, described on a xref:/midpoint/reference/samples/iot-cloud/thingspeak-resource/[separate page].


== Devices (services)

Each thermometer device is modeled as midPoint service with the following properties:

[%autowidth]
|===
| Property | Description | Source | Example

| name
| Serial number
| Provided by device on self-registration
| 74743827342


| displayName
| Name as shown in midPoint
| Edited by the customer via midPoint GUI
| Captain's cabin


| identifier
| ThingSpeak channel ID
| Provided by ThingSpeak on channel creation
| 144872


| extension/readKey
| ThingSpeak channel read API key
| Provided by ThingSpeak on channel creation (or when key changes)
| F8R5M7GTJ1PW8Q44


| extension/writeKey
| ThingSpeak channel write API key
| Provided by ThingSpeak on channel creation (or when key changes)
| 4OXD0MK3OT8O974Y


|===


== Roles

There are only two story-specific roles, serving for authorization control.

[%autowidth]
|===
| Role | Description

| Customer admin role
| Customer administrative user.
Can see all users, orgs and services (devices) within customer's organization.
Can modify objects to some extent.


| Customer user role
| Can see selected items in services (devices) in organization(s) whose he is a member of.
This allows customer administrator to perform quite flexible access control: by placing a user into org1, ..., orgN he allows the user to see all devices in these organizations.


|===


== Self-Registration Processes

Here we describe processes that run during self-registration of users (customers) and devices.


=== Customer Self-Registration

TODO


=== Device Self-Registration

A device contacts midPoint using the following URL

_http://<midpoint host and port>/midpoint/ws/iot/devices/<serialNumber>?key=<first-half-of-registration-key>_

The following algorithm is executed (see link:https://github.com/Evolveum/iot-story/blob/master/midpoint-iot-overlay/src/main/java/com/evolveum/smartwidgets/service/IoTRestService.java[IoTRestService class]):

. Find an organization O with a given first half of registration key (stored in extension/registrationLookupKey).
If not found (or if more than one is found), signal an exception.

. Find a resource R that is a membef of that organization.
Again, if zero or more than one is found, signal an exception.

. Find a service with a name equals to given serialNumber. +


.. If it doesn't exist, create it, with the properties of

... name = serialNumber

... description = "Thermometer <serialNumber>"

... assignment = organization O

... assignment = resource R (with kind = generic, intent = channel) +
(this causes provisioning of ThingSpeak channel for this device; eventually filling-in API keys for this device)





. Send the ThingSpeak channel identifier (identifier property) and write API key (extension/writeKey property), formatted as properties file in a text/plain response.
Like this:

channel=145736
writeKey=N35UIE4V3O1WMKH6

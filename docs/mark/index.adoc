== Introduction

Object Marks are light-weight marking mechanism for objects in order to ease
administration of Midpoint and/or induce specific behavior policies to marked
objects.

Marked objects could be filtered by mark in Admin GUI and may receive additional
policies based on effective marks.

Technically object marks are `MarkType` with archetype `Object Mark`.

IMPORTANT: Object Marks are only supported with Postgres Native Repository

IMPORTANT: Object Marks are currently only supported for shadows

== Basic Concepts

=== Effective Marks

Effective marks are marks, which are applied to object based on policies, or explicitly
specified by policy statements of the object.

Effective marks are stored in object `effectiveMarkRef` of type `ObjectReferenceType`
and are indexed by repository, so it is possible to use them for search.

=== Policy Statements

Effective marks could be manually added / induced / excluded from object
by modifying policy statement of particular object.

Policy statement has two main properties:

* *markRef* - object reference, which specifies mark
* *type* - enumeration, which specifies type of policy statement
** `apply` - referenced mark is manually added as effective mark
** `exclude` - referenced mark will not be effective, even if other policy may specify it so.

        <!-- Protected -->
    </markRef>
    <type>apply</type>
</policyStatement>
----

== Object Operation Policy

NOTE: In 4.7 object operation policy is only supported for shadow objects

Object Marks allows to specify operation policy, which may disable specific operations for marked objects.

Currently supported object operation policies for shadows are:

* `synchronize/inbound`
** if enabled, shadow is used for inbound synchronization
** if disabled shadow is excluded from inbound synchronization, changes on resource
   does not trigger mappings / recomputation of focus object
* `synchronize/outbound`
** if enabled, changes in focus object triggers changes in shadows
** if disabled, changes in focus object does not trigger mappings and are not propagated to resource
* `add`
* `modify`
** if disabled, any modifications of shadow (mappings or manual) results in error
* `delete`
** if disabled, shadow on resource can not be deleted (enforced in provisioning)

*Default object operation policy* for objects without marks specifying policy is to have *all operations enabled*.

If object has multiple effective marks specifying object operation policy, policies are merged, operations disabled by any of the marks are always disabled.

            </inbound>
            <outbound>
                <enabled>false</enabled>
                <severity>error</severity>
            </outbound>
        </synchronize>
        <add>
            <enabled>false</enabled>
            <severity>error</severity>
        </add>
        <modify>
            <enabled>false</enabled>
            <severity>error</severity>
        </modify>
        <delete>
            <enabled>false</enabled>
            <severity>error</severity>
        </delete>
    </objectOperationPolicy>

WARNING: Currently only severity `error` is supported for `add`,`modify`,`delete` operations.

=== Built-in Object Marks

==== Protected

Object Mark which denotes object (shadow) as Protected. Behavior of shadow marked with this mark is equivalent to setting it as protected in resource schema handling.

NOTE: In 4.7 if shadow is to be protected according to resource definition, shadow
is automatically marked `Protected` (`effectiveMarkRef`) and `objectOperationPolicy` defined in `Protected` mark enables protected behavior.

== GUI: Object Marks and Shadows

NOTE: In midPoint 4.7 object marks are only supported for shadows.

=== Marking Shadows in Resource Details

MidPoint GUI allows manually marking shadows in resource details view
using *Add Marks*, *Mark as Protected* actions in *Accounts* and *Entitlements*.

==== Workflow screenshots

.Go to Resource -> Accounts

.Click on Menu for Shadow

.Select Add Marks
image::resources-accounts-02.png[]

.Select Marks to be added to shadow
image::resources-accounts-03.png[]

=== Removing Shadow Marks in Resource Details

MidPoint GUI allows removing manually mark of shadows in resource details view using *Remove Marks* actions in *Accounts* and *Entitlements*.

==== Workflow screenshots
.Go to Resource -> Accounts, select accounts from which marks will be removed

.Click on Menu for Selected Shadows, Select Remove Marks

.Select Marks which should be removed from selected accounts
image::mark-shadow-remove-03.png[]

.Click Remove Marks to remove them
image::mark-shadow-remove-04.png[]

=== Marking Shadows in Simulation Results

MidPoint GUI allows manually marking shadows in Simulations results -> Processed Object views.
This is done by clicking menu icon and selecting Add Marks. Note that mark
is applied to real shadow (not simulated result). This allows for use-cases such as running simulations
and excluding particular shadows from real run.

NOTE: In Simulations GUI mark is applied to actual underlying object

==== Workflow screenshots

.Click on Menu icon for shadow
image::simulations-processed-object-01.png[]

.Select Add Marks

.Select Marks and click Add

=== Listing marked shadows across resources

In order to view all shadows marked by specific mark, you can navigate in midPoint GUI, to *Marks*, open specific object mark details and click on *Marked Shadows*.

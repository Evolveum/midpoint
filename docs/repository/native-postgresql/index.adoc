MidPoint stores its data in a relational database.
The database of choice for midPoint is PostgreSQL, leading open source relational database.
MidPoint contains implementation of data storage mechanisms (a.k.a. "repository") that tuned specifically for PostgreSQL database, taking advantage of PostgreSQL-specific features.

.Sqale
TIP: Native PostgreSQL repository implementation is nick-named "sqale" (read "scale") in midPoint source code.
The implementation can be found in `repo-sqale` component.
It was developed in midPoint 4.3 and 4.4 as a part of xref:/midpoint/projects/midscale/[midScale project].

== Compared to the Generic repository

This is just a short list of the main differences.
Native repository:

* supports only PostgreSQL database, but utilizes its features better;
* scales better and produces more efficient SQL queries (does not use Hibernate ORM anymore);
* uses PG inheritance for tables, e.g. `m_user` now contains all the columns, no JOINs needed;
* separate tables for various reference types (these are often joined, it should help);
* serialized objects (`fullObject`, `delta`) are stored as JSON by default (saves space)
and compression options are not available (left for the DB);
* has some filter interpretation improvements, e.g. support for `NOT EXISTS`, better multi-value support;
the differences are mentioned in the xref:/midpoint/reference/concepts/query/[midPoint Query] document;
* uses subqueries (`EXISTS`) instead of `JOIN`, common cases where `DISTINCT` was previously necessary are extremly rare now;
* uses single iterative search method, is strictly sequential, `iterationMethod` is ignored;
* extensions are stored in `JSONB` columns inline with the rows;
* supports xref:/midpoint/reference/repository/native-audit/#partitioning[audit table partitioning];
* finally, new repository *requires that OIDs are correct UUIDs*!

= Splitted Full Object
:page-since: "4.9"

Since midPoint 4.9 Native Repository does not store store all items in single `fullobject`, but for specific paths the items are serialized in separate tables.



== Trade-offs

Splitting some items in separate tables increases query count in order to fetch full objectbut allows for:

*  partial reads of objects (exluding paths and items not needed for GUI / processing)
** this functionality is available also to scripts.
* more effective read of role membership and assignments in GUI and reporting

== Backwards Compatibility

In order to ensure backwards compatibility all reads (get, searches) also fetch all items which have separate storage, unless get operation options specify otherwise.

== Items with separate storage

* `operationExecution` - All operation execution details are stored and loaded from `m_operation_execution` table.
* `assignment` - All assignment with their metadata are stored and loaded from `m_assignment` table. 
* `inducement` - All assignment with their metadata are stored and loaded from `m_assignment` table. 
* `linkRef` - All link references are stored and loadeed from `m_ref_projection` including their value metadata.
* `roleMembershipRef` - All role membership references are stored and loadeed from `m_role_membership` including their value metadata. 
    
== Migration

The repository migrates preexisting data with single full object to new splitted form on first modification of the object.

It is recommended to reindex repository after upgrade to 4.9 to have all data converted automatically to new storage format (without waiting for their first modification).

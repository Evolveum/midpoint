= Generic SQL Audit Trail
:page-nav-title: SQL Audit
:page-display-order: 15
:page-deprecated-since: "4.4"
:page-toc: top

[IMPORTANT]
This page documents the audit trail based on the old Generic SQL Repository.
For the new Native PostgreSQL audit trail see xref:/midpoint/reference/repository/native-audit/[this page].

== Configuration overview

SQL auditing is configured in `config.xml` inside
xref:/midpoint/reference/deployment/midpoint-home-directory/[midPoint home directory],
also known as `midpoint.home`.

See xref:/midpoint/reference/security/audit/[Auditing] for more general information about auditing
and some other configuration options, not specific for the SQL trail implementation.
These options, often realized via *SystemConfiguration* object customizations, are not covered in this document.

SQL audit trail for the old Generic Repository is enabled in `audit` configuration element by
adding `auditService` element containing `auditServiceFactoryClass` element with the value
`com.evolveum.midpoint.repo.sql.SqlAuditServiceFactory`.

For example, the `audit` section may look like this (the first `auditService` is not related to the repository):

[source,xml]
----
<audit>
    <auditService>
        <auditServiceFactoryClass>com.evolveum.midpoint.audit.impl.LoggerAuditServiceFactory</auditServiceFactoryClass>
    </auditService>
    <auditService>
        <auditServiceFactoryClass>com.evolveum.midpoint.repo.sql.SqlAuditServiceFactory</auditServiceFactoryClass>
    <auditService>
</audit>
----

Without further configuration, audit uses the same datasource as the main repository.
The audit tables (see below) must be part of the repository database - which is the default.

== Configuration options

=== Basic connection options

The following table lists the basic configuration options for the `repository` element:

[%autowidth]
|===
| Option | Description | Default

| `jdbcUrl`
| URL for JDBC connection.
This must be used (unless non-recommended `dataSource` is present) and can optionally conatain username and password.
See https://jdbc.postgresql.org/documentation/head/connect.html[Connecting to the Database] from PostgreSQL JDBC Driver documentation for more.
| `jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/midpoint`

| `jdbcUsername`
| Username for JDBC connection.
Can be empty, if username is not needed or provided in JDBC URL or otherwise.

Example: `midpoint`
|

| `jdbcPassword`
| Password for JDBC connection.
Can be empty, if password is not needed or provided in JDBC URL or otherwise.

Example: `password`
|

| `database`
| Ignored by the Native repository and cannot be changed - do not use it.
| `postgresql`

| `driverClassName`
| Ignored by the Native repository and cannot be changed - do not use it.
| `org.postgresql.Driver`

// TODO remove when 4.4 support ends
| `dataSource`
| Uses JNDI DataSource loading, when this option is defined in configuration.
This is only relevant for WAR deployment which is not recommended anyway.
`jdbcUrl`, `jdbcUsername`, `jdbcPassword`, and `driverClassName` is ignored and should not be used.
Example: `<dataSource>java:comp/env/jdbc/midpoint</dataSource>`

*WARNING:
This is obsolete functionality that is no longer supported or maintained.*
It is relevant only for WAR deployments on Tomcat and even there we recommend using explicit configuration using options above.
|
|===

==== Using empty username and password

It is possible to connect to the database without specifying password or username or both.
Examples are:

* Providing the username and password in JDBC URL.

* Using PostgreSQL trust authentication - though this is definitely not recommended for serious deployments.

Simply skip configuration elements *jdbcUsername* and *jdbcPassword*.
If everything is configured as expected, connection will be successful, otherwise JDBC driver will throw an exception and midPoint will not start.

=== Other connection pool options

All these options are optional, but can be used to fine-tune the repository setup.

MidPoint uses https://github.com/brettwooldridge/HikariCP[HikariCP] as a connection pool (version 4.x).
Detailed descriptions of connection pool related options can be found in
https://github.com/brettwooldridge/HikariCP#gear-configuration-knobs-baby[Hikari configuration documentation].
Names used below are the same as names used in HikariCP unless stated otherwise in the description.

All time values are in milliseconds (ms).

[%autowidth]
|===
| Option | Description | Default

| `minPoolSize`
| Minimal # of connections in connection pool, if connection pool is not provided through dataSource.

This option is called `minimumIdle` in HikariCP.
It is always set by midPoint, so HikariCP default is never used.

The value cannot be lower than 2 for midPoint, and - if set so, minimum value 2 will be used.
| `8`

| `maxPoolSize`
| Maximum # of connections in connection pool, if connection pool is not provided through dataSource.
Please, be aware that for the multi-node setup the total number of connections *must not* go above
the `max_connections` in the Postgres configuration, so this is a good default only up to 2 nodes.
See xref:../native-postgresql/postgresql-configuration/[PostgreSQL Configuration] for more tips.

When midPoint needs another connection from the pool it will wait for it.
The time is determined by the default value for HikariCP `connectionTimeout` option, which is 30s.
Currently, this cannot be changed in midPoint config, but it is a reasonable time.
But if the pool is oversized and HikariCP asks for the connection from the DB, and there is no free
connection available, the request fails immediately.

It is better to lower the pool size on the nodes to  that case.
Don't raise the `max_connections` in PostgreSQL without https://www.enterprisedb.com/postgres-tutorials/why-you-should-use-connection-pooling-when-setting-maxconnections-postgres[testing it first]!
It has far-reaching consequences and can actually hurt performance badly.

This option is called `maximumPoolSize` in HikariCP.
It is always set by midPoint, so HikariCP default is never used.

This value cannot be lower than `minPoolSize` - if set so, effective `minPoolSize` value is used.
| `40`

| `maxLifetime`
| Time after which the connection is retired from the pool.
This should be lower than any connection time limit used by the DB or the network infrasctructure.

The minimum allowed value is 30000ms (30 seconds).
| none, HikariCP sets 1800000 (30 minutes) by default

| `idleTimeout`
| Time after which an idle connection may be retired if current number of connections is higher than `minPoolSize`.

The minimum allowed value is 10000ms (10 seconds).
| none, HikariCP sets 600000 (10 minutes) by default

| `keepaliveTime`
| Controls the frequency for keepalive check on idle connections.
Keepalive ping contacts the DB backend, so it can prevent connection failures if some network infrastructure drops idle connections.

The minimum allowed value is 30000ms (30 seconds), 0 disables this feature.
| none, HikariCP sets 0 (disabled)

| `leakDetectionThreshold`
| If the connection is out of the pool (used by the application) for longer than the threshold, the message is logged
to indicate possible connection leak, including the stacktrace where the connection was obtained.

The minimum allowed value is 2000 (2 seconds), 0 disables this feature.
| none, HikariCP sets 0 (disabled)

| `initializationFailTimeout`
| Hikari pool initialization failure timeout, in milliseconds.
It is there to allow midPoint to wait until the repository is up and running and therefore to avoid failing prematurely.
| `1`

|===

=== Other repository configuration options

[%autowidth]
|===
| Option | Description | Default

| `fullObjectFormat`
| Property specifies format (language) used to store serialized object representation into
`m_object.fullObject` and other columns storing serialized object or container representation.
Supported values are `json` and `xml`.
This is safe to change any time, objects are read properly regardless of the format they are stored in.
| `json`

| `iterativeSearchByPagingBatchSize`
| The size of the "page" for iterative search, that is the maximum number of results returned by a single iteration.
This is a rather internal setting and the default value is reasonable balance between query overhead and
time to process the results.

It can be raised if the iterative search overhead (executing the select)
is too high compared to the time used for processing the page results.
| `100`

|===

There are no options for compression as this is left to PostgreSQL.
This also makes the inspection of the values in the columns easier.

== Audit tables

Audit logs are stored in five tables whose structure is described in code block below (part of DB script for H2 database).
You can find table structures for different DB vendors in out link:https://github.com/Evolveum/midpoint/tree/master/config/sql/generic[git],
or in the distribution packages in the folder `doc/config/sql/generic`.

* `id` column in `m_audit_event` table is now generated by default (auto increment).

* Columns `delta` and `fullResult` in `m_audit_delta` table are optionally compressed using GZIP.

When we need some other information in the audit table, we can add custom columns to the table in the database.
We can use new column to tag some special audit records for reporting.

Custom column have three parts of configuration:

. Creating column of `m_audit_event` table in database using SQL command.

. Adding of configuration for every custom column to `config.xml` file in Midpoint home directory.

. Adding of configuration of details how an audit event record property is created to system configuration file.

.1. Creating column of m_audit_event (H2 database)
[source,sql]
----
ALTER TABLE m_audit_event ADD custFoo VARCHAR(255);

CREATE INDEX iAuditEventCustFoo
    ON m_audit_event (custFoo);
----

When we want search by our column, we add index for it.
Please for name of our new column use 'custXXX' where XXX represents your name.
It is important in order to we obviate conflict with already exist columns.

.2. Adding of configuration for every custom column to config.xml file
[source]
----
<configuration>
    <midpoint>
        ...
        <audit>
            <auditService>
                <auditServiceFactoryClass>com.evolveum.midpoint.audit.impl.LoggerAuditServiceFactory</auditServiceFactoryClass>
            </auditService>
            <auditService>
                <auditServiceFactoryClass>com.evolveum.midpoint.repo.sql.SqlAuditServiceFactory</auditServiceFactoryClass>
                <customColumn>
                    <columnName>custFoo</columnName>
                    <eventRecordPropertyName>foo</eventRecordPropertyName>
                </customColumn>
            </auditService>
        </audit>
        ...
    </midpoint>
</configuration>
----

After adding of this configuration is needed restart of midpoint.

.3. Details how an audit event record property is created
[source,xml]
----
<systemConfiguration>
    ...
    <audit>
        <eventRecording>
            <property>
                <name>foo</name>
                <expression>
                    <path>$target/extension/foo</path>
                </expression>
            </property>
        </eventRecording>
    </audit>
    ...
</systemConfiguration>
----

We can use a script in expression for obtaining some special information.
In the script we can use variable `target`, which represent target object of audit record, and `auditRecord`, which represent audit record itself (type `AuditEventRecord`).

An example with custom column is available link:https://github.com/Evolveum/midpoint-samples/tree/master/samples/audit[in the samples].

== Configuration examples

=== Audit to main repository + logs

SQL repository + auditing to PostgreSQL, audit also to logs.
If *auditService* for *SqlAuditServiceFactory* does not contain any other configuration, main repository configuration is used - in fact, the same data source (connection pool, etc.) is shared.

[source,xml]
----
<repository>
    <repositoryServiceFactoryClass>com.evolveum.midpoint.repo.sql.SqlRepositoryFactory</repositoryServiceFactoryClass>
    <embedded>false</embedded>
    <driverClassName>org.postgresql.Driver</driverClassName>
    <hibernateHbm2ddl>update</hibernateHbm2ddl>
    <hibernateDialect>org.hibernate.dialect.PostgreSQLDialect</hibernateDialect>
    <jdbcPassword>midpoint</jdbcPassword>
    <jdbcUsername>midpoint</jdbcUsername>
    <jdbcUrl>jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/midpoint</jdbcUrl>
</repository>
<audit>
    <auditService>
        <auditServiceFactoryClass>com.evolveum.midpoint.audit.impl.LoggerAuditServiceFactory</auditServiceFactoryClass>
    </auditService>
    <auditService>
        <auditServiceFactoryClass>com.evolveum.midpoint.repo.sql.SqlAuditServiceFactory</auditServiceFactoryClass>
    <auditService>
</audit>
----

=== Audit to separate database

++++
{% include since.html since="4.2" %}
++++

Configuration element *auditService* for *SqlAuditServiceFactory* can contain any element from *repository* configuration - see xref:/midpoint/reference/repository/generic/configuration/[Repository Configuration] for more.

* One of *jdbcUrl* or *dataSource* must be used - otherwise any repository configuration in *auditService* is ignored and only main *repository* configuration is used.

* The recommended way is to use *jdbcUrl* with *jdbcUsername*, *jdbcPassword* and *driverClassName* and *database*.

// TODO remove when 4.4 support ends
* Preconfigured *dataSource* for WAR deployment on application server or Tomcat is also possible - but this is not recommended anymore and not officially supported.

* In both cases the right value for *database* element should be used, e.g. *postgresql*.

* If the separate repository for audit is used, [.underline]#do not use H2# - this option is not supported.
Use only production-like settings.
It is however possible to use other database for audit while main repository is set to embedded H2, mostly for development/testing purposes.

* Separate database must be prepared in a similar way to the main database with tables, indexes and foreing keys containing "audit" created.
For PostgreSQL example, see xref:/midpoint/reference/repository/generic/postgresql/[PostgreSQL] page, section *Separate audit database*.

Example configuration with default H2 for main repository and PostgreSQL on localhost for audit:

[source,xml]
----
<repository>
    <repositoryServiceFactoryClass>com.evolveum.midpoint.repo.sql.SqlRepositoryFactory</repositoryServiceFactoryClass>
    <baseDir>${midpoint.home}</baseDir>
    <asServer>true</asServer>
</repository>
<audit>
    <auditService>
        <auditServiceFactoryClass>com.evolveum.midpoint.audit.impl.LoggerAuditServiceFactory</auditServiceFactoryClass>
    </auditService>
    <auditService>
        <auditServiceFactoryClass>com.evolveum.midpoint.repo.sql.SqlAuditServiceFactory</auditServiceFactoryClass>
        <jdbcUrl>jdbc:postgresql://localhost/midaudit</jdbcUrl>
        <database>postgresql</database>
        <jdbcUsername>midaudit</jdbcUsername>
        <jdbcPassword>password</jdbcPassword>
    </auditService>
</audit>

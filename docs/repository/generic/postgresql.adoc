== MidPoint Configuration

=== Database create

[source,sql]
----
CREATE USER midpoint WITH PASSWORD 'password' LOGIN SUPERUSER;
CREATE DATABASE midpoint WITH OWNER = midpoint ENCODING = 'UTF8' TABLESPACE = pg_default LC_COLLATE = 'en_US.UTF-8' LC_CTYPE = 'en_US.UTF-8' CONNECTION LIMIT = -1;
----

[NOTE]
====
.Collation
You're free to use different collation if it suits your needs although the following must be considered:

* PostgreSQL support for collation is based on available OS collations or ICU collations (these can't be used as default for the database).
Check https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/collation.html[collation documentation] for your version of PG to see more.
* Assure that case-sensitivity or insensitivity does not break task bucketing.
See bug:MID-6468[] for example.

=== Configuration sample

[source,xml]
----
<configuration>
    <midpoint>
        <repository>
            <repositoryServiceFactoryClass>com.evolveum.midpoint.repo.sql.SqlRepositoryFactory</repositoryServiceFactoryClass>
            <database>postgresql</database>
            <jdbcUsername>midpoint</jdbcUsername>
            <jdbcPassword>password</jdbcPassword>
            <jdbcUrl>jdbc:postgresql://localhost/midpoint</jdbcUrl>
        </repository>
    </midpoint>
</configuration>

----

=== Driver

Driver for this database is bundled in MidPoint WAR archive.

== Tips and Tricks

=== Ubuntu

==== Create Database User

[source]
----
sudo -u postgres createuser --pwprompt --no-superuser --no-createdb --no-createrole midpoint
----

==== Delete Database User

[source]
----
sudo -u postgres dropuser midpoint
----

==== Delete Database

[source]
----
sudo -u postgres dropdb midpoint
----

==== Create database

[source]
----
sudo -u postgres createdb --owner=midpoint midpoint
----

==== Run database script

[source]
----
psql --host=localhost --username=midpoint < postgresql-schema.sql
----

=== Working with explicit schema

To use different schema for midPoint database than the implicit `public` one, the following
commands can be used to create new schema, e.g. named `midpoint`, and set it as the first one
to be searched for when unqualified object names are used:

[source]
----
CREATE SCHEMA midpoint;
ALTER DATABASE db_midpoint SET search_path TO midpoint, public;
GRANT USAGE, SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA midpoint TO midpoint_user_role;
GRANT USAGE, SELECT ON ALL SEQUENCES IN SCHEMA midpoint TO midpoint_user_role;
----

== Performance tuning

=== Statement statistics

[WARNING]
While the module/extension exists in previous PostgreSQL versions the table `pg_stat_statements`
has more and renamed columns, so the examples below work only from version 13 on.

To track slow queries it is recommended to enable module https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/pgstatstatements.html[pg_stat_statements].
To enable it the module must be added to `postgresql.conf` like this:

----
shared_preload_libraries = 'pg_stat_statements'
----

If you already use `shared_preload_libraries`, add it to the comma separated list.
Database restart is required after this configuration change.

To track slow queries one can use query like this:

[source,sql]
----
-- before the first time, run this, otherwise the view doesn't exist
CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS pg_stat_statements;

-- remove "_exec" from columns for PG < 13
select
    (total_exec_time / 1000 / 60)::numeric(20,4) as total_min, -- min as minutes here
    mean_exec_time::numeric(20,2) as avg_ms,
    max_exec_time::numeric(20,2) as max_ms,
    calls,
    query
from pg_stat_statements
-- optional where to limit it to one database, if needed (e.g. shared/test DB)
-- where dbid = (select oid from pg_database where datname = 'midpoint')
order by 1 desc -- change order as necessary
limit 50;
----

=== Tuning indexes

TODO: PostgreSQL specific advices will be added together with the new repository.
In the meantime, check the xref:/midpoint/reference/repository/native-postgresql/db-maintenance/#index-tuning[generic indexing tips].

// TODO

== Development installation on Windows

(Tested in March 2020 with PostgreSQL 12.2)

=== Installation, initdb

To avoid any problems with admin rights we will install link:https://www.enterprisedb.com/download-postgresql-binaries[Postgres from ZIP archive] as suggested on link:https://www.postgresql.org/download/windows/[this page] (for advanced users â˜º).

* Unpack the archive, e.g. to `c:\work\tools\pgsql` (`pgsql` is the name of zipped directory).

* Optional: Add `C:\work\tools\pgsql\bin` to your `PATH` environment variable for convenience.

* Optional: Decide where you want your postgres data and set *PGDATA* environment variable.
This is useful for `initdb` and `pg_ctl` commands, but can be also provided with switches.
I strongly recommend setting this one.

* Run (and provide admin password and [.underline]#remember it#):
+
----
initdb.exe -E utf8 --auth-host=scram-sha-256 -U admin -W
----

** If you don't have `PGDAT`* set, provide the expected directory name with `-D` switch.

** By default, superuser is named `postgres`, you can use that, if you want.
This is useful on Linux where the name matches system username, less so on Windows.

If we try to mess with locales (e.g. `LC_CTYPE` is set) `initdb` command may fail mysteriously with:

[source]
----
initdb: error: The program "postgres" was found by "C:/work/tools/pgsql/bin/initdb.exe"
but was not the same version as initdb.
Check your installation.
----

This is the start of the locale related problems on Windows, but not the end of it.

* Start the database with: `pg_ctl start`

* Again, use `-D` switch if you don't have `PGDATA` set.

* Log in: `psql -W postgres admin`

** `-W` forces the password prompt and is not necessary, unless you already set some `psql` environment variables; `postgres` is name of the default database, `admin` is the username.

=== Creating user and database

Now we can create user and the database as indicated at the start of this page - but Windows uses different names for locales, so we simply leave this out and hope it will not matter for our development purposes.

[source,sql]
----
CREATE USER midpoint WITH PASSWORD 'password' LOGIN SUPERUSER;
CREATE DATABASE midpoint WITH OWNER = midpoint ENCODING = 'UTF8' TABLESPACE = pg_default CONNECTION LIMIT = -1;
----

If we try the locales provided above, it will very likely complain about it and fallback to something like `CPUTF-8`.

Now the database is up and running, operated manually with `pg_ctl start`/`stop`, fully under our control, no services, no access rights problems (provided the directories you used are available to you).

Then we want to populate the database, e.g. from the root of Midpoint repository:

----
psql midpoint midpoint < config\sql\postgresql-4.2-all.sql
----

=== Separate audit database

Since 4.2 midPoint allows for separate audit repository.
It is best to create another user and database for this, if we want to try it:

[source,sql]
----
CREATE USER midaudit WITH PASSWORD 'password' LOGIN SUPERUSER;
CREATE DATABASE midaudit WITH OWNER = midaudit ENCODING = 'UTF8' TABLESPACE = pg_default CONNECTION LIMIT = -1;
----

It is possible to populate it just like the main database, non-audit tables will simply not be used.
Alternatively, copy-paste only audit related tables and other objects:

* tables *m_audit_delta*, *m_audit_event*, *m_audit_item*, *m_audit_prop_value*, *m_audit_ref_value* and *m_audit_resource* (this will also create sequences *m_audit_event_id_seq*, *m_audit_prop_value_id_seq* and *m_audit_ref_value_id_seq*);

* indexes *iAuditDeltaRecordId* through *iAuditResourceOidRecordId* (anything with *audit* in the name, they are in one place in the *postgresql-4.2-all.sql* file);

* foreign keys containing *audit* - *fk_audit_delta* through *fk_audit_resource*.

=== Configuring midPoint

* Adjust the Midpoint configuration.
If you use multiple databases I recommend adding a new *midpoint.home*, e.g.: *c:\work\tmp\midpoint-home-postgres*

* Add `config.xml` there with the repository configured to use Postgres (the same as at the start of this page).

* Start your Midpoint application with switch: `-Dmidpoint.home=c:\work\tmp\midpoint-home-postgres`

To make `psql` easier to use you can set environment variables `PGHOST=localhost` (probably default), `PGPORT=5432` (probably default), `PGDATABASE=midpoint`, `PGUSER=midpoint`, `PGPASSWORD=password` (normally obviously unsafe).

[NOTE]
Installation up to this point does not allow connection from other machines and we don't need it for Midpoint and PostgreSQL running on the same machine.
In the next experiment, with PostgreSQL on a virtual machine, we have to solve this issue as well.

== Vagrantbox with PostgreSQL on Linux

(Tested in March 2020, based on bento/ubuntu-19.10 box, PostgreSQL is 11.7)

To shield ourselves from non-linux operating system, we can use power of link:https://www.vagrantup.com/[Vagrant]+link:https://www.virtualbox.org/[VirtualBox] combo - both must be installed in advance.

Instead of following the steps lower, you can also use polished Vagrantbox from here: link:https://github.com/virgo47/midpoint-vagrantboxes/tree/master/vagrant-midpoint-db-postgresql[vagrant-midpoint-db-postgresql]

=== Virtual machine provisioning

Create empty directory, which will be the working directory for this Vagrant environment, in our case representing a single Linux virtual machine we want to provision with PostgreSQL - we will call it _vagrant directory_. Create a single file called *Vagrantfile* there with the following content:

.Vagrantfile
[source,ruby]
----
# -*- mode: ruby -*-
# vi: set ft=ruby :

Vagrant.configure("2") do |config|
  # base Vagrantbox we're starting with
  config.vm.box = "bento/ubuntu-19.10"
  config.vm.box_check_update = false

  # multiple entries can be added, but we don't need web, and we need 8080 free on host
  # config.vm.network "forwarded_port", guest: 80, host: 8080
  # PostgreSQL
  config.vm.network "forwarded_port", guest: 5432, host: 5432

  config.vm.provider "virtualbox" do |vb|
  #   vb.gui = true
    vb.name = "postgres-linux"
    vb.memory = "1024"
  end

  config.vm.provision "shell", inline: <<-SHELL
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install -y postgresql postgresql-contrib
    sudo -i -u postgres psql -c "SELECT version();"

    # allow connections from outside (not just from localhost)
    sudo ed /etc/postgresql/*/main/postgresql.conf << EOF
/^#listen_addresses
i
# Listen on all interfaces to allow connections from outside
listen_addresses = '*'
.
wq
EOF
    sudo cat >> /etc/postgresql/*/main/pg_hba.conf << EOF
# Allow connections from outside (with password)
host    all             all             0.0.0.0/0            md5

EOF
    sudo service postgresql restart

    sudo -i -u postgres psql -c "CREATE USER midpoint WITH PASSWORD 'password' LOGIN SUPERUSER;"
    sudo -i -u postgres psql -c "CREATE DATABASE midpoint WITH OWNER = midpoint ENCODING = 'UTF8' TABLESPACE = pg_default LC_COLLATE = 'en_US.UTF-8' LC_CTYPE = 'en_US.UTF-8' CONNECTION LIMIT = -1;"

    # let's make it easy for "vagrant" user to use psql command
    sudo cat >> ~vagrant/.bashrc << EOF

export PGHOST=localhost
export PGPORT=5432
export PGDATABASE=midpoint
export PGUSER=midpoint
export PGPASSWORD=password

EOF

  SHELL
end
----

Now inside the _vagrant directory_ (the one with `Vagrantfile`) run: `vagrant up`

[NOTE]
No PostgreSQL can run on the host taking the 5432 port.
We either have to stop the Postgres on the host, or use different port for the host.
This is perfectly fine, but we have to change it later in JDBC URL as it will not be default anymore.

=== Using the VM

This will provision the virtual machine and starts it up for us.
Next vagrant up is faster, first provisioning always lasts longer.
Now we want to log into the machine: *vagrant ssh*

We can check that everthing works just running `psql`, checking the list of databases there with `\l`.
As we still don't have `midpoint` database populated, `\d` shows nothing.
Let's get out with: `\q`

To halt the VM later we need to get out of it (exit) and run `vagrant halt` on our host machine, still in our _vagrant directory_.
To restart it later just run `vagrant up` again.
VM remembers everything when used like this.

=== Populating the DB

There are two ways how to run the initial script:

* We can copy `postgresql-4.3-all.sql` to the vagrant directory, which is shared with the virtual machine as its `/vagrant` directory.
Then we can run from inside the box (as `vagrant` user):
+
----
psql < /vagrant/postgresql-4.2-all.sql
----

* Or we can use `psql` from the host machine, if PostgreSQL is available there.
Database port 5432 is forwarded from guest to host again as 5432, so it seems to be running on the host directly.

The first way has an advantage that we don't need to install anything additional on the host - Midpoint and driver is obvious prerequisite that we need anyway.
From here on it's again about setting the configuration, preferably in newly created `${midpoint.home}` that we provide to Midpoint using `-D` switch.

=== Vagrant advantages

One big advantage of using Vagrant is repeatability.
When we're done with our VM or we want to recreate it from scratch (e.g. something went wrong beyond repair) we just destroy it with: `vagrant destroy -f`

After that we just start it again with: `vagrant up`

This time it does not need to download the base box, but it still needs to provision it - that is to run update, PG install and other commands in the `Vagrantfile`, but this is much faster than manual work.

[WARNING]
====
Vagrant, or better said VirtualBox used under the hood, sometimes has its own problems.
If provisioning doesn't work as expected, first upgrade both tools and then restart the computer before trying again.
This helps most of the time.

You can also run the VM directly from VirtualBox, but this is not recommended for Vagrant managed boxes.
It may be needed to use VirtualBox to really get rid of some stuck VM.

Despite these possible annoying problems, I highly recommend Vagrant for provisioning of development environments.

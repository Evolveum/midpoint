[WARNING]
====
This scenario uses unfinished/experimental xref:/midpoint/reference/synchronization/linked-objects/named-object-links/[named object links] feature.
It is very powerful but even more experimental than linked objects feature as a whole!
So beware, everything described here can change any time.
====

== Overview

Let us work with projects modeled as `OrgType` objects of archetype `project`. Each project named `P` has two child orgs.
The first (named `<P>_users`, having archetype of `project-users`) contains users working on that particular project.
The second (named `<P>_groups`, having archetype of `project-groups`) contains groups that are related to that project.

. When a project is created, those children have to be created automatically.

. When a project is renamed, those two children should be renamed automatically.

. When a project is deleted, those children have to be deleted automatically.

== An implementation overview

As usual, the implementation has two parts:

. Implementing the data transfers as such.
There are two simple mappings (that set sub-orgs `name` attribute) that ensure this.

. Triggering the recomputation of linked objects.
There are three policy rules doing that.

== Data transfer implementation using mappings

This is how `project-users` archetype looks like:

                <strength>strong</strength>

                    <script>
                        <code>
                            parent = midpoint.findLinkedTarget('parent')
                            parent ? parent.name + '_users' : null
                        </code>
                    </script>
                </expression>

            </mapping>
        </focusMappings>
    </inducement>

</archetype>

----

First of all, a link type of `parent` is defined.
It denotes the parent org of any "users" sub-org.

The mapping that follows derives sub-org name from the name of the parent by suffixing it by "_users" text.
Nothing special here.

The archetype of `project-groups` looks exactly the same.

inked user (if any).
And the mapping returns the value for the `description` property accordingly.

== Change propagation

All what is needed to propagate changes (creation/modification/deletion of parent org) is present in `project` archetype.
It starts like this:

<archetype xmlns="http://midpoint.evolveum.com/xml/ns/public/common/common-3"
           xmlns:s="http://midpoint.evolveum.com/xml/ns/public/model/scripting-3"
           oid="4d3280a1-6514-4984-ac2c-7e56c05af258">

        3. They need to be renamed when project is renamed.
    </documentation>

                    <archetypeRef oid="3af67ba4-183f-45e7-887e-4ae5ddff4cdf" /> <!-- project-users -->

            </sourceLink>
        </links>
    </archetypePolicy>
    ...
</archetype>

----

We see a definition of two link types here.
One is called `usersOrg` and points to the `OrgType` of  `project-users` archetype that has the `project` as its parent (assignment target).
The other one is called `groupsOrg` and points to the `OrgType` of  `project-groups` archetype that - again - has the `project` as its parent.



=== Project creation

Further there is a policy rule that creates children when `project` org is created:

           oid="4d3280a1-6514-4984-ac2c-7e56c05af258">
    ...
    <inducement>
        <policyRule>
            <name>create-children-on-new-project-creation</name>
            <documentation>

            </policyConstraints>
            <policyActions>
                <scriptExecution>
                    <!-- no object spec, so executed on the object itself -->
                    <executeScript>
                        <s:pipeline>
                            <s:execute>
                                <s:script>
                                    <code>
                                        // Returning two objects - they will be created in the second action
                                        [midpoint.createLinkedSource('usersOrg'),
                                         midpoint.createLinkedSource('groupsOrg')]
                                    </code>
                                </s:script>
                                <s:outputTypeName>OrgType</s:outputTypeName>
                            </s:execute>
                            <s:add/> <!-- creates objects prepared above -->
                        </s:pipeline>
                    </executeScript>
                </scriptExecution>
            </policyActions>
        </policyRule>
    </inducement>
    ...
</archetype>

----

It is executed against the `project` org itself - no linkSource/linkTarget specification is there.
And it is a two-step pipeline:

. The first step uses `midpoint.createLinkedSource` method (of PoC quality only, rather unfinished) to create objects from the respective link type specifications.
Those objects are very simple, each one contains only a reference to its parent (the project) and its archetype (derived from the link type).
Everything else is computed from the archetype itself in the second step.

. And the second step i.e. `s:add` action creates the objects.

=== Project deletion

What about deletion?

.Policy rule for children deletion

<archetype xmlns="http://midpoint.evolveum.com/xml/ns/public/common/common-3"
           xmlns:s="http://midpoint.evolveum.com/xml/ns/public/model/scripting-3"
           oid="4d3280a1-6514-4984-ac2c-7e56c05af258">
    ...
    <!--
     Actually, this one is fake: assignments/inducements are NOT evaluated on object deletion (yet).
     So the same rule is included as a global policy rule in system configuration.
     -->
    <inducement>
        <policyRule>
            <name>delete-children-on-project-deletion</name>
            <documentation>
                Deletes children when project is deleted.
            </documentation>
            <policyConstraints>
                <modification>
                    <operation>delete</operation>
                </modification>
            </policyConstraints>
            <policyActions>
                <scriptExecution>
                    <object>
                        <namedLinkSource>usersOrg</namedLinkSource>
                        <namedLinkSource>groupsOrg</namedLinkSource>
                    </object>
                    <executeScript>
                        <s:delete/>
                    </executeScript>
                </scriptExecution>
            </policyActions>
        </policyRule>
    </inducement>
    ...
</archetype>

----

The policy rule should look like the above.
Unfortunately, those assigned rules are ignored on object deletion, so we must place this rule into system configuration as a global policy rule instead:

.Global policy rule for children deletion
[source,xml]
----
<!-- This role is here because of assignments not being applied on object deletion. -->
<globalPolicyRule>
    <focusSelector>

        <archetypeRef oid="4d3280a1-6514-4984-ac2c-7e56c05af258" /> <!-- project -->
    </focusSelector>
    <name>delete-children-on-project-deletion</name>

        </modification>
    </policyConstraints>
    <policyActions>
        <scriptExecution>
            <object>
                <namedLinkSource>usersOrg</namedLinkSource>
                <namedLinkSource>groupsOrg</namedLinkSource>
            </object>
            <executeScript>
                <s:delete/>
            </executeScript>
        </scriptExecution>
    </policyActions>
</globalPolicyRule>

=== Project modification (renaming)

And, finally this is the policy rule dealing with project renaming:

    ...
    <inducement>

            </policyConstraints>
            <policyActions>
                <scriptExecution>
                    <object>
                        <namedLinkSource>usersOrg</namedLinkSource>
                        <namedLinkSource>groupsOrg</namedLinkSource>
                    </object>
                    <executeScript>
                        <s:recompute/>
                    </executeScript>
                </scriptExecution>
            </policyActions>
        </policyRule>
    </inducement>
</archetype>
----

It is quite self-describing.

Only a small note here: `<namedLinkSource>X</namedLinkSource>` element is, in fact, a shortcut for `<linkSource><linkType>X</linkType></linkSource>`. We'll see if it should be preserved in the future or if it will be discontinued because of redundancy.

Complete configuration for this scenario is in link:https://github.com/Evolveum/midpoint/tree/master/model/model-intest/src/test/resources/linked/projects[https://github.com/Evolveum/midpoint/tree/master/model/model-intest/src/test/resources/linked/projects] directory (and system configuration in the parent one).

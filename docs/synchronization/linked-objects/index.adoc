[[introduction]]
== Introduction

MidPoint objects do not live in isolation.
Often they need to take data from related objects.
And so if an object changes, the change needs to be cascaded to related objects.

This page introduces the topic theoretically.

== Links between objects

There are many kinds of links among objects.
They are differentiated by the _relation_ attribute of a particular object reference.
(For more information on relations, see xref:/midpoint/reference/concepts/relation/[Relation] and xref:/midpoint/reference/concepts/relation/relation-configuration/[Relation Configuration].)

These are typical situations when two objects are linked:

.Situations when objects are linked

|===
| Situation | Link source | Link target | Relation | Note

| User A has a role R.
| User A
| Role R
| org:default

| User A is a member of org O.
| User A

== Assignments vs. links

A link between two objects can be:

.Links between objects
[%autowidth]
|===
| Type of link | Stored in

| prescribed
| `assignment`


| actual
| `roleMembershipRef`
// Is this name still valid?

|===

So the link between two objects (A → B) can be in one of the following states:

.Object link states
[%autowidth]
|===
| Prescribed | Actual | Description

| Yes
| Yes
| The usual case.
There is an assignment from A to B. The assignment is valid and effective, so the information is in `roleMembershipRef` as well.

| Yes
| No
| There is an assignment from A to B. But it is either invalid (from the activation point of view) or not effective (from the conditions point of view), so there is no record in `roleMembershipRef`.

| No
| Yes
| There is no direct assignment from A to B, but the link was created indirectly, e.g., via an inducement, such as from A to B, where B induces C. So A → C is not prescribed but actual.

| No
| No
| A and B have no link altogether, or there is an indirect assignment that is not valid or not effective.

|===


== Navigating links

Each link has two participants:

.Link participants
[%autowidth]
|===
| Participant | Meaning

| Link source
| Object that has something linked.
Usually it is the holder (owner) of the respective assignment.

| Link target
| Something that is linked to the object.

|===

In mappings we can use the following methods to find the other side of our links:

.Methods for determining link source and target
[%autowidth]
|===
| Method | To be invoked on | Meaning | Search criteria | Version returning single object

| `midpoint.findLinkedTargets`
| link source
| Returns all linked objects matching specified criteria.
| object type, archetype (experimental: link type name)
| `findLinkedTarget`

| `midpoint.findLinkedSources`
| link target
| Returns all objects that have the current one as link target.
| object type (experimental: link type name)
| `findLinkedSource`

|===

Note that `findLinkedTargets` should be used [.underline]#only after assignments are processed# as it needs fresh information from assignment evaluation.
Therefore:

* You cannot use `findLinkedTargets` in inbound mappings.
* If you use `findLinkedTargets` in object templates, you need to specify the `evaluationPhase` of `afterAssignments`.
* You can use `findLinkedTargets` in assigned/induced focus mappings or resource outbound mappings.

On the other hand, `findLinkedSources` has no such limitation.
For examples, see individual <<introduction,scenarios>> for linked objects.

[NOTE]
====
The `midpoint.findLinkedTargets`  method has _relativistic behavior_: it returns data derived from the _new_ state of a focal object if evaluating the new state, and the data derived from _old_ `roleMembershipRef` values if evaluating the old state.

On the other hand, `midpoint.findLinkedSources` returns the same data in both the old and new stats, because the links from sources to the focal object are not changed in the course of the focal object processing.
====


== Cascading the changes

We often need to recompute one side of the link when relevant parts of an object on the other side (or the link itself) change.
We usually use a policy rule with a `scriptExecution` policy action for this.


=== Selecting objects to be recomputed

The `scriptExecution` policy action has an option to specify objects to which the given midPoint script (action) should be applied.
This option is called `object` and has the following values:

.scriptExecution policy options
[%autowidth]
|===
| Option | Cardinality | Action is run on | Option value type | Note

| `currentObject`
| single
| The current focus object.
This is the default if nothing is specified.
| `ObjectSelectorType`
|


| `linkTarget`
| multiple
| Objects that are targets of links coming from this object (i.e. results of assignments of this objects) are recomputed.
| `LinkTargetObjectSelectorType`
|

| `linkSource`
| multiple
| Objects that are sources of links coming to this objects (i.e. objects that have assignments to this object) are recomputed.
| `LinkSourceObjectSelectorType`
|

| `namedLinkTarget`
| multiple
| A shortcut for `linkTarget` with a specified `linkType`.
| `string`
| Experimental.
May be removed.

| `namedLinkSource`
| multiple
| A shortcut for `linkSource` with a specified `linkType`.
| `string`
| Experimental.
May be removed.

|===

Object sets coming from individual options and also from individual values of these options are added together.

The values of the above options are used to select what specific link targets or sources to use; and under what conditions the current object is to be selected.
You can use these filters (and-ed together when present in a single value):

.Filters for specifying link targets and sources
[%autowidth]
|===
| Filter | Meaning | ObjectSelectorType | LinkTargetObjectSelectorType | LinkSourceObjectSelectorType

| `type`
| Type of the object.
| yes
| yes
| yes

| `subtype`
| Subtype of the object.
| yes
| yes
| yes

| `archetypeRef`
| Archetype of the object.
| yes
| yes
| yes

| `orgRef`
| Top node of an organizational hierarchy.
This node and all of its subnodes (transitively, unlimited depth) are considered matching.
| yes
| yes
| yes

| `filter`
| Filter that an object must match to be considered selected.
This filter MUST NOT contain organization unit clauses.
It may only contain property clauses, logical operations and so on.
| yes
| yes
| yes

| `relation`
| Link matches if it has any of the relations specified.
(If no relation is specified, all relations match.)
|
| yes
| yes


| `linkType`
| Name of the declared link type.
(Experimental)
|
| yes
| yes

| `changeSituation`
| Filters objects to which policy actions apply based on how links to those objects have changed.
See the <<changeSituationValues,available values>>.
|
| yes
|

| `matchesRuleAssignment`
| The link target is related to the assignment that brought this policy rule to the focus object.
This setting can eliminate the need to specify linked targets, e.g., via archetype, if the archetype itself brings this policy rule to the object. +
This filter is not precise as it ignores relations, and also whether the assignment that brought this policy rule was really the one that is listed in (old/new) `roleMembershipRef`.
Do not use this if you need absolute precision.
|
| yes
|


| `matchesConstraint`
| The link target was matched by a policy constraint in this rule (e.g., an assignment modification constraint has a target object equal to the assignment target).
This setting can eliminate the need to specify linked targets, e.g., by using archetypes. +
Highly experimental, probably will be removed.
|
| yes
|

|===

[[changeSituationValues]]
Possible values of the `changeSituation` filter are:

.changeSituation values
[%autowidth]
|===
| Value | Meaning | Old existence | New existence

| `always`
| Always matches (default), even if the link was removed.
| any (X)
| any (Y)

| `added`
| Matches only if the link has been added.
| false
| true

| `removed`
| Matches only if the link has been removed.
| true
| false

| `inNew`
| Matches if the link exists in the new state.
| any (X)
| true

| `inOld`
| Matches if the link exists in the old state.
| true
| any (X)

| `changed`
| Matches if the state of the link's existence has changed, i.e., if it has been added or removed.
| any (X)
| not X

| `unchanged`
| Matches if the state of the link's existence has _not_ changed.
| any (X)
| X

               </linkTarget>
            </object>

            </executeScript>
        </scriptExecution>
    </policyActions>
</policyRule>
----

This rule triggers a recomputation of all linked objects with specified archetype when the `name` or `fullName` of the current object is modified.
For more information on object recomputation, see xref:/midpoint/reference/misc/bulk/actions/recompute/[recompute].


=== Asynchronous execution

In situations where there are many objects to be recomputed, you can specify _asynchronous execution_, i.e., execution of the recomputation in the context of a background task.

This is done using the `asynchronousExecution` item containing the following options:

.asynchronousExecution options
[%autowidth]
|===
| Option | Meaning | Example

| `executionMode`
| Mode of asynchronous script execution.
| `iterative` (the default)

| `taskTemplateRef`
| Reference to the task template, i.e., the task that is used as a template (prototype) of the actual task being created.
|


| `taskCustomizer`
| An expression that takes a task and customizes its content. +
[.underline]#Input variable:#`preparedTask`  (of `TaskType`). +
[.underline]#Output:# object of `TaskType` type that should be used. +
The script can simply modify `preparedTask` and return it, see <<task_customizer,an example>>.
Note that this is the final step in task preparation, and so the task is executed in the form that is prepared by this expression.
|

|===


==== Asynchronous execution modes

The following modes are available:

.Asynchronous execution modes
[%autowidth]
|===
| Execution mode | Meaning | Note

| `iterative`
| Uses an iterative scripting handler, i.e., an object query with a script that processes every object found.
| This is the default and recommended option.

| `singleRun`
| Uses a single-run scripting action.
Input for this action contains references to objects that should serve as action inputs.
.2+| To be used in special cases only. 
// what cases are those special cases?

| `singleRunNoInput`
| Uses single-run scripting action without any explicit input.

|===


==== Task templates

The task template can contain any options you want to be present in the final task.
Its state should be `waiting` or `closed` to avoid being run independently.
The following items are set for the final task (so overwriting the items present in the template):

.Task template parameters
[%autowidth]
|===
| Item | Meaning | Value set

| `name`
| Task name
| Name of the task template (or Execute script if no template is specified) plus a random number suffix.
// what is the "Execute script"?


| `ownerRef`
| Task owner
| Currently logged-in user, or the user specified in `runAsRef` for script execution policy action.


| `executionStatus`
| Task execution status
| `RUNNABLE` (The task should be run.)


| archetype assignment
| Task archetype
| `00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000509` (Iterative bulk action task) for iterative execution mode and `00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000508` (Single bulk action task) for other execution modes.


|===

`taskTemplateRef` can contain an object filter, even with expressions.
Those expressions can refer to the `focus`, `policyAction`, `policyRule` and `configuration`. variables.

.Example of taskTemplateRef
[source,xml]
----
<asynchronousExecution>
    <executionMode>iterative</executionMode>
    <taskTemplateRef>

                            import com.evolveum.midpoint.xml.ns._public.common.common_3.OrgType
                            focus instanceof OrgType ? '9c50ac7e-73c0-45cf-85e7-9a94959242f9' : '9107b8a4-0a0a-4e82-a4c6-9d84034f9d6e'
                        ```
            </q:text>
        </filter>
    </taskTemplateRef>
    ...
</asynchronousExecution>
----

[[task_customizer]]
==== Task customizer

You can specify any other task properties (or delete any pre-set ones) using a special expression that expects `preparedTask` as its input and should return a modified task object.
The returned object can be the one that was received as input (with necessary modifications).

.Example taskCustomizer
[source,xml]
----
<asynchronousExecution>
    <taskCustomizer>
        <script>
            <!-- This script assumes the existence of the `memberRecomputationWorkerThreads` integer property in the `ModelExecutionOptionsType` extension.
                 It uses the value of this option to set worker threads (mext:workerThreads task property) for given task. -->
            <code>
                log.info('Task being prepared = {}', preparedTask.asPrismObject().debugDump())
                preparedTask.description = 'Hello there'
                workerThreads = midpoint.getExtensionOptionRealValue('memberRecomputationWorkerThreads')
                basic.setTaskWorkerThreads(preparedTask, workerThreads)
                preparedTask
            </code>
        </script>
    </taskCustomizer>
</asynchronousExecution>
----


=== Delaying recomputation using triggers

There are situations when you want to delay the recomputation.
A typical case is when you want to recompute members of abstract roles that are (potentially) changed on a larger scale.
For example, when they are synchronized from a resource.
Or if they are modified using an action.
Or if it is simply expected that users are going to edit more roles via GUI in a short period of time (relative to the time needed to recompute members of those roles).

In such cases you can set a recompute trigger on the relevant objects instead of recomputing them immediately.
The trigger can be set either unconditionally, or for a given time in the future.
The latter option optimizes even the creation of the triggers by skipping triggers that are known to be redundant.
See xref:/midpoint/reference/misc/bulk/actions/recompute/[recompute] for more details.

Note: Triggers can be set synchronously or asynchronously.
The asynchronous option is suitable for roles with lots of members.


=== Enabling/disabling the change propagation

The original recompute affected option has an advantage that it can be turned on or off directly when submitting the operation, e.g., via GUI.
In order to implement a similar mechanism we devised a concept of `ModelExecuteOptions` _extension items_. You can define these using standard extension mechanism, for example:
// what is meant by "the original recompute affected option" ?

And then you could check for this option in conditions related to the particular policy rules, for example:

            </script>
        </expression>
    </condition>
</inducement>
----

The specific options cannot be (now) set via GUI.
However, they can be specified in actions, synchronization reactions, or anywhere where the model API is called from a Java or Groovy code.
In the near future we will implement support also for REST calls.
// is support for REST calls already implemented?

[TIP]

Authorizations should be checked when processing execution options.
Currently they are not.

== Security aspects

* The `midpoint.findLinkedSources` and `findLinkedTargets` methods use the model API to retrieve objects, so they are executed under privileges of the currently logged-in user.
You can use the `runAsRef` mechanism in expressions to define a different user, if needed.

* Scripts (actions) in scripting policy rules also execute under privileges of the currently logged-in user.
You can use `scriptExecution.runAsRef` to define a different user. *
There is one exception, though: to increase performance, the search for relevant objects (linked sources or targets) is done directly via the repository.
So the security is not being applied there.
This might change in the future.


== Performance considerations

There are many topics related to performance to consider, including the following:

* Should change propagation be processed in the foreground or background? +
If there are only a few linked objects, and if their recomputation is fast, it can be done on the foreground.
If you only want to trigger the recomputation via triggers, it can be also done in the foreground (even for a slightly larger sets of linked objects).
But for all other cases, background processing is preferred.
And, if processing more focus objects with potentially overlapping sets of linked objects, using triggers is strongly advised to avoid repeated recomputation.

* Where should you use change propagation policy rules? +
For example, in the user  device scenario (xref:/midpoint/reference/synchronization/linked-objects/scenario-2-devices-owned-by-users/[Linked objects scenario 2: Devices owned by users]), policy rule that causes the recomputation of linked devices can be put either into the user archetype (with order 1 inducement) or the device archetype (with order 2 inducement). +
The advantage of the latter case is that it is applied to the user only if the user has at least one device (so sparing some processing time.) The disadvantage is that if a user has multiple devices, the policy rule is present multiple times: once for each device.
And here comes the distinction: if the rule recomputes _all devices_, this would lead to their repeated recomputation.
So, if you have a rule that recomputes all linked objects of a kind, then it should be induced only once, i.e. assigned to the user from the user archetype.
If the rule recomputes only relevant devices (using the `matchesRuleAssignment` or `matchesConstraint` clause) or it is expected that there is at most one matching linked object, it can be attached to target's archetype.

* Looking for sources and targets in the `midpoint.findLinkedSource` and `midpoint.findLinkedSource` methods. +
The former uses a traditional repository query, as it has no hints of who the sources could be.
It can be fast or slow, depending on the complexity of the query and the number of objects returned.
Fortunately, the result should be cached (locally or globally), so the repo cost will be incurred only once.
When looking for targets, the candidate set of objects is taken from assignments and preliminarily filtered on object type.
However, further filtering requires fetching these objects by their OID.
In extreme cases, that might present hundreds of objects.
The repo calls should be cached.
However, in both cases, the objects pass tbhe model `getObject`/`searchObjects` methods, so all the model processing (security, template, post read hooks) is applied.
And as it is not treated by cache, it is applied each time those methods are used.
If this is an issue, you need to write your own (optimized) versions of these methods or, providing that a platform subscription is in place, request such changes from Evolveum.

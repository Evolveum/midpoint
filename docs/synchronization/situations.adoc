When midPoint detects a synchronization event it  is categorized into one of the _situations_.
The _situation_ describes how the change relates to the midPoint state regarding the changed
resource object (account), user and the midPoint policies.

== Situations

The situations are described in the following table.

[%autowidth]
|===
| Situation | Description | Examples | Usualreactions

| `linked`
| The resource object is linked to an appropriate focal object.

E.g. the account is linked to a user.
| Change in account attributes only.

Redelivery of a change notification that was already delivered and processed.

Reconciliation found not mismatch for this account.
|


| `collision`
| The resource object is linked to two or more focal objects.

E.g. The account is linked to two or more IDM users.
| Error in IDM business logic or inconsistent database.
Should not happen.
[.red]#Do we need this situation?#
|


| `deleted`
| The resource object has been deleted.

E.g. The account existed on the resource, but it has been deleted.
| A legal account is manually deleted on the Resource.
| `unlink` +
`deleteFocus` +
`inactivateFocus` +
`addShadow`


| `unlinked`
| A resource object is found on the resource (it exists), midPoint determines exactly one owner
for that resource object and that owner does not have the resource object linked (yet).

E.g. New account is found on the resource, an owner (midPoint user) is found by using a correlation expression.
| The account was created on the resource using native administration tools.
Initial (incremental) import.
| `link` +
`deleteShadow` +
`inactivateShadow`


| `unmatched`
| A resource object is found on the resource (it exists) and midPoint cannot determine any owner for the object.

E.g. New account is found on the resource, it is (obviosly) not linked to any user and correlation expression returns no candidate owners.
| New account was created on the resource using native administration tools and the account has wrong username.

Initial import.

New account created on an authoritative resource (e.g. HR system)
| `addFocus` +
`deleteShadow` +
`inactivateShadow`


| `disputed`
| Two or more owners are determined for a single resource object.

E.g. new account is found on the resource and two or more users are returned.
| An ambiguous account is created manually on the resource, e.g. using a username `smith` that matches surname of several users.
| `deleteShadow` +
`inactivateShadow`


|===

The situations deal only with existence or non-existence of resource object (account) and with ownership of the account.
In other words it deals only with "links".
It does *not* deal with the legality of the account (whether the user should have the account).
See xref:/midpoint/reference/roles-policies/assignment/assigning-vs-linking/[Assigning vs Linking] page for a more detailed explanation.
The situations also does *not* deal with change in account attributes.

== The Algorithm

MidPoint is using the following algorithm to determine a situation:

. If the resource object is deleted then the situation is *deleted*.

. Resource object owner is looked up.
The owner is an object that has a xref:/midpoint/reference/roles-policies/assignment/assigning-vs-linking/[link] to this resource object.
If an owner is found then the situation is *linked*.

. xref:/midpoint/reference/synchronization/correlation-and-confirmation-expressions/[Correlation and confirmation expressions] are used to determine a potential owner for the resource object.
If any potential owners are found the situation is *unlinked* or *disputed*.

. The situation is *unmatched*.

== Situation Overview

Following table summarizes the differences among situations from the point of view of detected account operation and the number of owners (or potential owners).

[%autowidth,cols="h,1,1,1,1"]
|===
h| Detected operation on account
h| Link exists (user has account)
3+h| Link does not exist, correlation&confirmation found users

h|

h| 0
h| 1
h| 2 or more


| ADD

| MODIFY

| `unmatched`
| `unlinked`
| `disputed`

== Introduction

MidPoint xref:/midpoint/reference/roles-policies/roles/rbac/[roles] are usually applied to users.
However, midPoint roles are quite universal things.
The roles can be applied to almost any midPoint object.
Roles can be applied to users, organizations, services - and even to roles themselves.
Which creates _metaroles_.

Simply speaking, metaroles are roles applied to other roles.
Ordinary role applies its characteristics to a _user_.
Metarole applies its characteristics to another _role_ or similar role-like object.
This is perfectly possible in midPoint, as roles can be applied to almost any midPoint object.
Applying roles to other roles may seem like a useless exercise but the truth is that metaroles are tremendously useful.

Repetition is extensive in almost all identity management deployments.
For example, all _business roles_ may have the same approval process.
There may be role classes that have similar exclusion policies, as part of a global segregation of duties (SoD) policy.
There may be roles that are tied to entitlements in a systematic way.
Roles, organizational units, services, and other role-like objects tend to be quite similar.
Therefore, defining the policy in one metarole and applying that metarole to multiple other roles can be very useful.

feature:archetype[Archetypes] and feature:policy-concept[policy objects] act as natural metaroles, which is clearly illustrated by using policy objects as feature:information-classification[classifications].

There are also other objects that can act as metaroles:
 
* feature:abstract-role[Abstract roles] such as feature:org[orgs] and feature:service-concept[services]
* feature:application-concept[Applications] can be quite useful when used as metaroles.

== Mechanism

Metaroles are (abstract) roles that are _assigned_ to other roles.
In metaroles, policies are applied to target roles through _inducement_:

[source,xml]
----
<role oid="6924fb9c-a184-11e9-840e-2feb476335f4">
    <name>Account Manager</name>
    <description>
        This is business role that corresponds to account manager job.
    </description>
    <assignment>
        <!-- Metarole assignment -->
        <targetRef oid="a3065910-a183-11e9-835c-0b6edc3d44c3" type="ArchetypeType"/>
    </assignment>
    <inducement>
        <!--
             Privileges specific to account manager.
        -->
    </inducement>
</role>

<archetype oid="a3065910-a183-11e9-835c-0b6edc3d44c3">
    <name>Business role</name>
    <inducement>
        <!--
            Policies and constructions that should be applied to all
            business roles.
        -->
    </inducement>
</archetype>
----

In this case, the feature:archetype[archetype] acts as a metarole.
In fact, archetype is an archetype:abstract-role[abstract role] which means that it is just like a role, with some extra mechanisms that enrich objects, for example with icons and colors.
In this example, the archetype acts as metarole, specifying common policies and characteristics for all objects that have the archetype _assigned_.

At first sight, metaroles may seem similar to the concept of xref:/midpoint/reference/roles-policies/roles/rbac/[role hierarchy].
However, there is a crucial difference.
Metaroles are applied to _roles_, not users.
Inducements in metaroles often contain _policies_, such as approval policies.
There may also be construction clauses that create groups or organizational units, which is often used in xref:/midpoint/reference/roles-policies/policies/metaroles/gensync/[generic synchronization].
We usually do not want to create a group for each _user_, but we often want to create a group for a _role_.
That is what metaroles can do.

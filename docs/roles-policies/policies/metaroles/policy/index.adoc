== Introduction

MidPoint is a very flexible system, especially when it comes to xref:/midpoint/reference/roles-policies/policy-rules/[policies], xref:/midpoint/reference/cases/approval/[approvals], and other identity governance mechanisms.
However, the flexibility comes at a cost.
Policy definitions can be quite complex.
Some of this complexity is inherent and cannot really be avoided.
However, once potentially complex policies are created, then it should be quite easy to apply them to individual objects such as users and roles.
The mechanism of xref:/midpoint/reference/roles-policies/metaroles/[metaroles] can be used exactly for this purpose.

The basic idea is to express policies in a form of metaroles.
For example, a policy that drives role assignment through an approval will be expressed in an "approval by manager" metarole.
This metarole will contain all xref:/midpoint/reference/roles-policies/policy-rules/[policy rules] necessary to express the approval policy.
Those policy rules may be quite complex, but they are all conveniently packed into the metarole.
All that remains is to assign the metarole to an object to which it should apply - which is usually a role.
So, we end up with a role with an assignment to another role.
And that is what we call a xref:/midpoint/reference/roles-policies/metaroles/[metarole].
The situation looks like this:

image::assignments-rbac-policy-metarole.png[]

The schema above illustrates an application of approval policy to a `Supervisor` role.
`Supervisor` is an ordinary business or an application role.
After creating the role, we want to apply a usual approval policy to it.
The usual approval policy is specified in the `Approval by manager` metarole.
This metarole specifies all the necessary policy rules.
However, those rules are specified inside an xref:/midpoint/reference/roles-policies/assignment/assignment-vs-inducement/[inducement].
Therefore the policy rules do not apply to the role which contains them, i.e. the rules do not apply to the `Approval by manager` metarole.
Those policy rules will apply to any object that has the metarole assigned.
In this case, it is the `Supervisor` role.
The `Supervisor` role will be affected by the defined policy rules.

== Examples

See the following examples of how you can apply metaroles to create approval policies:

* <<manager_approval,Approval by manager>>
* <<approver_approval,Approval by approver>>


[[manager_approval]]
=== Approval By Manager

The following metarole contains a "manager" approval policy.
When this metarole is applied to an ordinary role, the approval policy is applied to that ordinary role.
When that ordinary role is assigned to a user, the request is driven through an xref:/midpoint/reference/cases/approval/[approval process].
In this case, the approval will be requested from the user's manager.

----

This approval policy is specified in a feature:policy-concept[policy object], which is a special type of object meant to act as a metarole.
This approach is convenient when you want to manage policies in GUI using the feature:applicable-policies["applicable policy"] feature.

[[approver_approval]]
=== Approval By Approver

The following metarole contains an "approver" approval policy.
When this metarole is applied to an ordinary role, the approval policy is applied to that ordinary role.
When that ordinary role is assigned to a user, the request is driven through an xref:/midpoint/reference/cases/approval/[approval process].
In this case, the approval will be requested from the person that is designated as the role approver.

The policy rule above will drive the role through an approval of a role approver.
The role approver is determined by examining all users that have this role assigned with a special-purpose `approver` xref:/midpoint/reference/concepts/relation/[relation].
For more details, see the xref:/midpoint/reference/cases/approval/[description of the approval mechanism].

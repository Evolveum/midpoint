= Identity Governance Rules
:page-keywords: [ 'governance', 'relationship', 'rules', 'ownership' ]
:page-upkeep-status: green

Identity governance is based on high-level business-oriented rules, that are mostly concerned with responsibilities.

== Mechanism Overview

In midPoint environment, identity governance rules are implemented by use of xref:../policy-rules/[policy rules] and xref:/midpoint/reference/concepts/mark/[marks]:

. Policy rules are checking whether governance rules are followed.
E.g. policy rule could check whether an application has an owner.

. Policy rules sets appropriate xref:/midpoint/reference/concepts/mark/[marks] when it is violated.
E.g. a policy rules sets _Orphaned_ mark in case that an application does not have an owner.

. Policy rules are placed into appropriate objects, such as xref:/midpoint/reference/schema/policy/[policies] and xref:/midpoint/reference/schema/archetypes/[archetypes].
Policies and archetypes group policy rules, forming concepts with business meaning, such as "behavior of business roles" or "Application containing sensitive data".
The policies and archetypes are applied to individual objects in the ordinary way (usually by using xref:/midpoint/reference/roles-policies/roles/assignment/[assignment]).

. Marks are applied to the objects as specified by the rules.
These are _effective_ marks: they are applied by the rules, but they are also removed by the rules as necessary.

. Marks applied to individual objets can be used to display, report and address the violations using several mechanisms, such as dashboard, reports and reviews.
The marks are also displayed during ordinary GUI interactions, thus attracting attention to policy violations.

== Enforcing Application Owners

Requirement that every application should have an owner is present in almost every identity governance scenario.
The ideal place for implementation of this governance rule is _Application_ archetype.
_Application_ archetype is a pre-configured object (present in default xref:/midpoint/reference/deployment/initial-objects/[initial objects]) which is applied to all applications.
Therefore, natural method of enforcing the policy is to apply it at an archetype level.

MidPoint comes with a couple of xref:/midpoint/reference/roles-policies/preconfigured-policies/[pre-configured policies] that are ready-made to be applied.
In case of ownership requirement, there is pre-configured policy `Require owner`.
When this policy is applied to an archetype, all objects of that archetype are required to have at least one owner.
As the xref:/midpoint/reference/schema/archetypes/[archetype] efficiently acts as a xref:/midpoint/reference/roles-policies/metaroles/[meta-role], the policy rule in the inducement is applied to all applications.

The policy can be applied by assigning the policy to the archetype:

.Ownership requirement policy applied to application archetype
[source,xml]
----
<archetype oid="00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000329">
    <name>Application</name>
    <assignment>
        <targetRef oid="6451bca8-4035-4fb3-8ab1-5de14da59e18" type="PolicyType"/>
    </assignment>
</archetype>

<policy oid="6451bca8-4035-4fb3-8ab1-5de14da59e18">
    <name>Require owner</name>
    ...
    <inducement>
        <identifier>policy-require-owner</identifier>
        ...
    </inducement>
</policy>
----

Inducement in the `Require owner` policy contains a policy rule, that sets `Unowned` mark when the affected object does not have an owner.
Applications that violate this policy are displayed on xref:/midpoint/reference/admin-gui/dashboards/compliance-dashboard/[compliance dashboard].
When this policy is applied to applications for the first time, all applications need to be recomputed.
Recomputation triggers evaluation of the policies, which sets or clears the marks as appropriate.

TIP: The `Require owner` policy is implemented in the _inducement_ in the `Require owner` policy object.
This is order 2 inducement, which means it does not apply to the assignee object (`Application` archetype).
The inducement rather applies to all objects that have `Application` archetype assigned.
This is the xref:/midpoint/reference/roles-policies/metaroles/[meta-role mechanism] in action.

== Dashboards and Reporting

Once the policy is applied and the archetype and the affected objects (applications) are recomputed, the violations are recorded in a form of object mark.
The objects that violate the rule can be found by querying the _effective mark_ reference:

.Unowned mark query
[source]
----
effectiveMarkRef matches ( oid = "5508aca4-2aef-47a6-ad50-892389823c91" )
----

This query can be used in midPoint user interface.
However, it is much more practical to set up corresponding xref:/midpoint/reference/admin-gui/collections-views/[object collection], which can be later re-used:

.Unowned applications object collection
[source,xml]
----
<objectCollection oid="cc8c1397-e5c4-456c-bd98-f07b3dca97ec">
    <name>Unowned applications</name>
    <type>ServiceType</type>
    <filter>
        <q:text>effectiveMarkRef matches ( oid = "5508aca4-2aef-47a6-ad50-892389823c91" ) and archetypeRef matches ( oid = "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000329" )</q:text>
    </filter>
    ...
</objectCollection>
----

TIP: The `Unowned` mark as well as `Unowned applications` object collections are part of default midPoint configuration (xref:/midpoint/reference/deployment/initial-objects/[initial objects]).

Such object collection can be easily used in xref:/midpoint/reference/admin-gui/dashboards/[dashboard] widget:

.Unowned applications dashboard widget
[source,xml]
----
<dashboard oid="f941f3fc-dcef-4415-9e79-ae56b185a501">
    <name>compliance-dashboard</name>
    ....
    <widget>
        <identifier>orphaned-applications</identifier>
        <display>
            <label>
                <orig>Applications without owners</orig>
            </label>
            <icon>
                <cssClass>fa fa-user-xmark</cssClass>
            </icon>
            <color>var(--success)</color>
        </display>
        <displayOrder>110</displayOrder>
        <data>
            <sourceType>objectCollection</sourceType>
            <collection>
                <collectionRef oid="cc8c1397-e5c4-456c-bd98-f07b3dca97ec" type="c:ObjectCollectionType"/>
            </collection>
        </data>
        <presentation>
            <dataField>
                <fieldType>value</fieldType>
                <expression>
                    <proportional>
                        <style>value-only</style>
                    </proportional>
                </expression>
            </dataField>
        </presentation>
    </widget>
</dashboard>
----

== Custom Policy Rules

Custom policy rules can be implemented in a similar fashion.
There are several options.
The simpler option is to include the rules directly in the archetype (or similar xref:/midpoint/architecture/concepts/abstract-role/[role-like object]).
Following rule requires all business roles to have at least one approver.

.Business role archetype
[source,xml]
----
<archetype oid="00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000329">
    <name>Business role</name>
    ...
    <inducement>
        <identifier>business-role-require-approver</identifier>
        <policyRule>
            <name>rule-require-approver</name>
            <policyConstraints>
                <minAssignees>
                    <name>constraint-require-approver</name>
                    <multiplicity>1</multiplicity>
                    <relation>org:approver</relation>
                </minAssignees>
            </policyConstraints>
            <markRef oid="aa44a866-6311-11f0-9896-57fdbf809a6a"/> <!-- "Broken process" mark -->
            <policyActions>
                <record>
                    <description>Record the mark for use in dashboards and reports.</description>
                </record>
            </policyActions>
            <evaluationTarget>object</evaluationTarget>
        </policyRule>
    </inducement>
</archetype>
----

The rule has one `minAssignees` that requires at least one assignee with relation `approver` to be present for the affected object (application) at any time.
In case that the rule is violated, object mark _Broken process_ will be applied to affected object.

NOTE: The policy rule evaluation target must be set to `object` for this rule to work properly.
Use `evaluationTarget` clause of the policy rule for this purpose.

The rule is setting _Broken process_ mark to every effected object, which means it efficiently marks all business roles without approvers.
However, such mark is not part of default midPoint configuration, therefore it has to be created first:

.Broken process mark
[source,xml]
----
<mark oid="aa44a866-6311-11f0-9896-57fdbf809a6a">
    <name>Broken process</name>
    <description>Mark for object that have process-related misconfigurations.</description>
    <display>
        <icon>
            <cssClass>fa fa-user-xmark</cssClass>
        </icon>
    </display>
    <assignment id="1">
        <identifier>archetype</identifier>
        <targetRef oid="00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000701" type="ArchetypeType"/>
    </assignment>
</mark>
----

NOTE: MidPoint has a set of marks pre-configured as part of its xref:/midpoint/reference/deployment/initial-objects/[initial objects].
Pre-configured object marks that are part of the initial objects can be re-used for custom policy rules.
However, it is very likely that creation of new custom marks could be required.

== Custom Packaged Policies

The above method placed policy rule directly to the affected archetype.
While this is completely feasible and correct approach, re-use of such policies is somehow limited.
When it is expected that a certain policy could be re-used, there is a much better approach.
Policy rules implementing such a policy can be placed into a dedicated xref:/midpoint/reference/schema/policy/[policy object], which "packages" the policy.

.Require approver policy
[source,xml]
----
<policy oid="36103ab2-6313-11f0-b5d6-cf6a2e7b791d">
    <name>Require approver</name>
    ...
    <inducement>
        <identifier>policy-require-approver</identifier>
        <orderConstraint>
            <order>2</order>
        </orderConstraint>
        <policyRule>
            <name>rule-require-approver</name>
            <policyConstraints>
                <minAssignees>
                    <name>constraint-require-approver</name>
                    <multiplicity>1</multiplicity>
                    <relation>org:approver</relation>
                </minAssignees>
            </policyConstraints>
            <markRef oid="aa44a866-6311-11f0-9896-57fdbf809a6a"/> <!-- "Broken process" mark -->
            <policyActions>
                <record>
                    <description>Record the mark for use in dashboards and reports.</description>
                </record>
            </policyActions>
            <evaluationTarget>object</evaluationTarget>
        </policyRule>
    </inducement>
</policy>
----

NOTE: The _inducement_ in the `Require approver` policy object is order 2 inducement.
Such inducement does not apply to the assignee object (`Business role` archetype), it rather applies to all objects that have `Business role` archetype assigned.
See xref:/midpoint/reference/roles-policies/policies/metaroles/[meta-role mechanism] for more details.

Such packaged policy can be applied to `Business role` archetype by assignment:

.Approver requirement policy applied to business role archetype
[source,xml]
----
<archetype oid="00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000321">
    <name>Business role</name>
    <assignment>
        <targetRef oid="36103ab2-6313-11f0-b5d6-cf6a2e7b791d" type="PolicyType"/>
    </assignment>
</archetype>
----

The packaging of the policies is an advantage for reuse, but also for governance.
All the related policy rules that implement certain policy can be neatly packaged inside one object.
The resulting policy object encapsulates the policy.
This makes policies easy to maintain and manage.
E.g. the policy can be reviewed as one logical unit, it can have an owner, changes to the policy can be managed using approval process and so on.

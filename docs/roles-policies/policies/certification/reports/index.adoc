See <<certification_definitions_report,an example>>.


| Certification campaigns report
| All certification campaigns along with their states.
See <<certification_campaigns_report,an example>>.


| Certification cases report

See <<certification_cases_report,an example>>.

[NOTE]
====
"Last closed" is not updated if a campaign is deleted without being properly closed.

[[certification_campaigns_report]]
=== Certification campaigns report

[NOTE]
====
* "Stage cases" shows how many cases are open in the current review stage, or were open in the review stage that was last open.

* "% complete" is computed based on the percentage of cases that are missing one or more reviewers' responses.
So if there are, for example, 10 cases in total, out of which 8 are open in the current stage, and out of which 6 are completed (i.e. all assigned reviewers have provided their answers), the % complete is shown as 80% (because there are 2 incomplete cases out of 10).

[[certification_cases_report]]
=== Certification cases report

.*Certification cases report*

[NOTE]
====
* "In stage" displays the stage that the case was last considered in.
Depending on the xref:/midpoint/reference/roles-policies/policies/certification/determining-case-outcome/[review strategy], some cases might be "stopped": they do not advance to the next stage after being e.g. revoked in a previous stage.

* "Reviewers" represent the reviewers who are currently assigned, or who were assigned for a review stage in which this case was last considered in.

* "Reviewed by" is a list of all reviewers for all stages up until now.

* "Outcome" is a preliminarily computed result for the case for the whole campaign.

* "Comments" are joined comments from all reviewers that have provided them.

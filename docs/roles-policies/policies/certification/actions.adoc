This page explains the different certification actions that reviewers can use in the midPoint user interface.
You can use this information to better understand what each action does and how it affects the certification process.

== General Information

Reviewers come across certification actions throughout the midPoint GUI.
These actions control what happens next in campaigns.
There can be inline menu actions or toolbar actions in the object list tables, redirecting actions executed from different widgets (e.g. _View all_ action from the _My accesses_ widget on the _Dashboard_ page), etc.

In this document, we'll have a look at the inline menu actions configuration.

WARNING: This feature is still under development and the configuration may change in the future.
For now, inline menu actions can be configured only for the certification items collection view.

== Configure Inline Menu Actions

Action configuration is done within the _Object Collection View_ configuration.

Actions should have identifiers that match the <<available_actions,available actions>>.

Some actions may require prerequisite steps before they can be executed.
For example, actions may require confirmation, or parameters that need to be filled in.
In these cases, the action configuration should contain the _panel_ section.

See an example of an inline menu action configuration for the certification items collection view:

[source,xml]
----
<action>
    <identifier>certItemAccept</identifier>
    <panel>
        <display>
            <label>Do you really want to accept the item(s)?</label>
        </display>
        <container>
            <identifier>comment</identifier>
            <display>
                <label>Please, provide a comment (required).</label>
            </display>
            <item>
                <path>output/comment</path>
                <mandatory>true</mandatory>
            </item>
        </container>
        <type>AccessCertificationWorkItemType</type>
    </panel>
</action>

----

The configuration above defines an Accept action for certification items.
The action requires a confirmation and a comment to be filled in.

[[available_actions]]
=== Available Actions

As mentioned above, inline menu actions can be configured only for the certification items collection view for now.
Therefore, the list of the available actions is limited to the certification items actions.

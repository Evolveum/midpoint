In midPoint, Roles are a fundamental concept used to organize and manage access rights and privileges within an identity governance and administration (IGA) system.
A role represents a collection of permissions, entitlements, and other attributes that define what a user can do within the system.
Roles are assigned to users, and when a user is assigned a role, they inherit all the rights and entitlements defined by that role.
This mechanism simplifies access management by grouping related permissions into a single entity, reducing the administrative burden of managing individual permissions for each user.

Roles in midPoint are defined using the xref:/midpoint/architecture/archive/data-model/midpoint-common-schema/roletype/[`RoleType`] data type, which is part of the midPoint schema.
This data type includes various properties such as name, description, activation status, and a set of assignments.
These assignments can include other roles (creating a role hierarchy), entitlements, and account constructions.

The role hierarchy allows for the creation of complex access control structures, where higher-level roles can inherit the permissions of lower-level roles. This hierarchical structure is essential for implementing advanced access control policies and for managing large and dynamic organizations.

MidPoint supports a wide range of role-related features.

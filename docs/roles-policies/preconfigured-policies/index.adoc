Default midPoint configuration includes pre-packaged polices, in a ready-to-use form.
Following polices are included in midPoint xref:/midpoint/reference/deployment/initial-objects/[initial objects]:

|===
| Policy | Applied to | When violated | Description

| `Require owner`
| Archetypes
| Applies mark `Unowned`
| Requires that all archetyped objects have at least one owner.

| `Require classification`
| Archetypes
| Applies mark `No classification`
| Requires that all archetyped objects have a xref:/midpoint/reference/roles-policies/classification/[classification].

|===

The policies can be used by assigning them to objects specified in the _Applied to_ column above.
E.g. the `Require owner` policy can be applied by assigning this policy to the `Application` archetype, which sets the requirement that all applications must have at least one owner.

NOTE: Affected objects have to be explicitly recomputed after the policy is applied for the policy to take effect.

== Limitations

* The policies can be applied only to selected set of objects.
Currently, the policies are designed to be applied to archetypes, not individual objects (applications, roles).
This could be improved in future midPoint versions.

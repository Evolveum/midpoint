== General Information

The user of the midPoint meets with GUI actions all over the system.
There can be the inline menu actions or toolbar actions in the object list tables, redirecting actions executed from different widgets (e.g. _View all_ action from the _My accesses_ widget on the _Dashboard_ page), etc.
The goal is to have these actions configurable in the midPoint GUI.
In this document, we'll have a look at the inline menu actions configuration.

WARNING: This feature is still under development and the configuration may change in the future.
For now, inline menu actions can be configured only for the certification items collection view.

== Inline Menu Actions Configuration

Action configuration is done within the _Object Collection View_ configuration.
Action should contain the identifier.
The identifier should match one of the list of the available actions which is provided further in this document.
Some actions may require additional steps to be provided before the action can be executed.
For example, the action may require a confirmation.
Or the action may require filling in some parameters.
In these cases the action configuration should contain the _panel_ section.

Let's have a look at the example of the inline menu action configuration for the certification items collection view:

[source,xml]
----
                <action>
                    <identifier>certItemAccept</identifier>
                    <panel>
                        <display>
                            <label>Do you really want to accept the item(s)?</label>
                        </display>
                        <container>
                            <identifier>comment</identifier>
                            <display>
                                <label>Please, provide a comment (required)</label>
                            </display>
                            <item>
                                <path>output/comment</path>
                                <mandatory>true</mandatory>
                            </item>
                        </container>
                        <type>AccessCertificationWorkItemType</type>
                    </panel>
                </action>

----

The configuration above defines Accept action for the certification items.
The action requires a confirmation and a comment to be filled in.

=== Available Actions

As it was mentioned above, inline menu actions can be configured only for the certification items collection view for now.
Therefore, the list of the available actions is limited to the certification items actions.

Certification module provides the following notifications:

[%autowidth]
|===
| Event | Recipient(s) | Comment

| Campaign start
| campaign owner
| Emitted when the stage 1 is started.
(Along with "campaign stage start" described next.)


| Campaign stage start
| campaign owner
| Sent when a new review or remediation stage is opened.


| Campaign review stage end approaching
| campaign owner
| Sent when a deadline for a review stage is approaching, i.e. X hours before the deadline.
X is a number set by the "notifyBeforeDeadline" parameter.
It is interpreted as a number of hours.
This parameter is multivalued, so a notification can be sent e.g. 48 and 6 hours before the deadline occurs.


| Campaign review stage end
| campaign owner
| Sent when a review stage is closed.


| Campaign end
| campaign owner
| Sent when a campaign as such is closed.
(Not if it is deleted before being actually closed!)


| Review request
| reviewer
| Emitted when a review is requested for a set of cases.
(Currently, this is done at the same time as "campaign review stage start" event is created.
I.e. when the campaign stage is started, one notification is sent to the campaign owner and one to each of the reviewers.)


| Review deadline approaching
| reviewer
|


|===

*Planned* events (i.e. not implemented yet):

[%autowidth]
|===
| Event | Recipient(s) | Comment

| Case final decision
| campaign ownerand maybe case owner
| This event is generated when a certification case is decided.
I.e. when there we don't expect any changes in the state of this case as part of the approval processes.
(Either when it's finally rejected or when last stage is closed.)


| Case remediation
| campaign ownerand maybe case owner
| This event is generated when a certification case is remedied.


|===

Note that the recipients listed are the default ones.
By configuring the notifiers appropriately - namely, by overriding the recipientExpression - you can define other recipients as well.
You can also override the notification messages subjects and bodies.


== An example of notifications sent

The following snipped of the system configuration object can be used to configure certification notifications:

[source,xml]
----
<notificationConfiguration>
    <handler>
        <simpleReviewerNotifier>
            <transport>mail</transport>
        </simpleReviewerNotifier>
        <simpleCampaignNotifier>
            <transport>mail</transport>
        </simpleCampaignNotifier>
        <simpleCampaignStageNotifier>
            <transport>mail</transport>
        </simpleCampaignStageNotifier>
    </handler>
    <mail>
        <server>
            <host>smtp.gmail.com</host>
            <port>587</port>
            <username>...</username>
            <password>...</password>
            <transportSecurity>starttlsEnabled</transportSecurity>
         </server>
         <redirectToFile>d:\midpoint\home\mail-notifications.txt</redirectToFile>		<!-- just for debugging -->
      </mail>
</notificationConfiguration>
----

Now we create a certification definition "Test" having two stages:

[source,xml]

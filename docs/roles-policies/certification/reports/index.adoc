== Access Certification Reports

There are currently four pre-configured certification-related reports available in the midPoint distribution package:

[%autowidth]
|===
| Report name | Content

| Certification definitions report
| All certification definitions with basic information on related campaigns (number of campaigns, date when a campaign of this type was last started and closed).


| Certification campaigns report
| All certification campaigns along with their state.


| Certification cases report
| Cases within a given certification campaign.


| Certification work items report
| Decisions of individual reviewers for a certification campaign as a whole or for a given campaign stage.
This is the most detailed report.


|===

The default export type is CSV as a default for object collection based reports.

== Examples

Notes:

. "last closed" is not updated if a campaign is deleted without being properly closed.

.*Certification campaigns report*

Notes:

. "Stage cases" means what cases are open in the current review stage - or were open in a review stage that was last open.

. "% complete" is computed based on a percentage of cases that are missing one or more reviewers' response.
So if there are e.g. 10 cases total, out of which 8 ones are open in the current stage, out of which are 6 that are completed (i.e. all assigned reviewers have provided their answers), the % complete is shown as 80% (because there are 2 incomplete cases out of 10).

Notes:

. "In stage" is the stage that the case was last considered in.
Depending on the xref:/midpoint/reference/roles-policies/certification/determining-case-outcome/[review strategy], some cases might be "stopped": they do not advance to next stage after being e.g. revoked in some (previous) stage.

. "Reviewers" are reviewers that are currently assigned - or were assigned for a review stage in what this case was last considered in.

. "Reviewed by" is a list of all reviewers for all stages up to now.

. "Outcome" is a preliminarily computed result for the case for the whole campaign.

. "Comments" are joined comments from all reviewers that have provided them.

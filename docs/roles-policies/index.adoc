This section describes two different object types in midPoint: Roles, and Policies.

While Policies extend from Roles, they serve a distinct purpose, and are designed to address more advanced business and governance needs.
Roles are ideal for defining _what_ access or entitlements a user should receive, while Policies control _how_, _when_, and under _which conditions_ that access is granted.

* *Roles* grant access or responsibilities to users.
+
They are applied to objects, mainly users, and they are typically used to represent job functions or access rights, such as "HR Manager" or "read access to Project XYZ".
See xref:/midpoint/reference/roles-policies/roles/[].

* *Policies* control how access is granted, reviewed or approved.
+
They are applied to objects (typically roles and services) to which you want to apply some defined behavior, and they are used to enforce business logic and compliance.
+
While some policies may be quite simple and may only "mark" objects with properties that indicate, for example, a passed training, others may be more complex and may contain policy rules that define more comprehensive conditions and behaviors based on how those conditions evaluate.
See xref:/midpoint/reference/roles-policies/policies/[].

In the application, these two concepts are represented by separate sections:

// TODO: figure

MidPoint has quite a rich xref:/midpoint/architecture/archive/data-model/midpoint-common-schema/usertype/[user schema] with many attributes that are common for most IDM deployments.
But if there are attributes that are not really common the best option is to extend user schema.
It is quite easy.
The User schema is extended by adding appropriate XSD schema to the midPoint installation.
The schema extension is stored in the database as a SchemaType that contains an attribute for the schema in XSD format.
You can also use the XSD file in the midPoint home directory as in previous versions.

The custom schema extension is specified in the XML Schema Description (XSD) format similar to other schemas in midPoint.
It is using XSD annotations to specify details that XSD cannot specify.
E.g. it is using an `a:extension` annotation to bind the complex type definition to the midPoint object type.

== Example

Following example provides a custom schema extension.
It extends the schema of UserType as is defined by the `a:extension` XSD annotation.
The example defines two properties: `officeNumber` and `favoriteColor`.

----

This file is all it takes to extend the schema.
It extends user with two custom attributes:

[%autowidth]
|===
| Name | Display Name | Type |

| `officeNumber`
| office number
| string
| Optional, single-value

| `favoriteColors`
| favorite color
| string
| Optional, multi-value

| `facility`
| facility
| string
| Mandatory, single-value

| `officePhone`
| office telephone number
| string
| Mandatory, single-value

|===

Attribute name is the name by which midPoint knows the attribute.
It is used in xref:/midpoint/reference/expressions/[mappings] and configuration.
Display name is what midPoint will display in forms and reports.
Attribute type determines the type and range or attribute values.
The schema may also define attribute multiplicity, whether it is mandatory or optional, define the order in which it will be displayed in forms, define a help text, etc.
Most of that is defined using XSD annotations and it is optional.

Defining the schema extension is all that midPoint needs to make full use of the attribute.
Once it is defined in the schema midPoint will display the attribute in the GUI and it will be displayed
using suitable user field, checked for mandatory value, the attribute may be used in mappings, etc.
It will behave as if it was always a part of midPoint.
The small additional configuration is required only when these attributes are used in mappings.
Then you have to let configuration know in which namespace it should look for an attribute definition.
This is the namespace introduced by the attribute `targetNamespace` in the header of the extension XSD file.

A more complex schema examples are provided in the git link:https://github.com/Evolveum/midpoint-samples/tree/master/samples/schema[samples/schema directory].

== Installing Custom Schema Extension

Currently, unlike previous versions, the schema extension does not need to be present in midPoint at startup time.
It is stored in the xref:/midpoint/reference/repository/[repository (database)]
and can be dynamically changed when the system is running.

The schema is stored in the `definition` attribute of `SchemaType`. This attribute contains the schema in XSD format.
When MidPoint starts and after each SchemaType is saved, all schemas of all SchemaTypes are loaded.

=== Changing Custom Schema Extension via GUI

From midpoint 4.9, schemas can be configured via GUI panels.
After each change, the schema is reloaded and you can immediately see the new attributes
in the GUI panels of the extended object type.

When we create a new schema, a new complex type or a new item, the GUI panel has no limitations.
However, when we modify it, we run into certain limitations related to the schema lifecycle.
Deleting schemas, complex types or items is forbidden because some objects may contain values for attributes created by that schema, complex type or item.
Another reason is that we need old attributes in schemas for the correct display of deltas in audit records.
Unnecessary attributes should be marked as removed, but should remain in the schema extension.

Limitations:

* Can't change `Namespace` of schema
* Can't change `Name` and  `Extension` of complex type
* Can't change `Name` and  `Type` of item
* Value of `Required` attribute of item can't change form `false` to true or undefined
* Value of `Multivalue` attribute of item can't change form `true` to false or undefined
* Container item can't mark as indexed
* Can't change `Object reference target type` of reference item
* Can't change `name`  of enumeration
* Can't change `value`  of enumeration value

These are limitations for GUI panels only, so if you want to, and you're sure it's correct, *you can change it directly via the XML file at your own risk.*.

== Data Types Supported

Extension items fall into two categories depending on how they are stored in midPoint repository: *indexed* and *not indexed*.

. Not indexed items are stored in object's XML representation only.
So they are preserved by the repository, but it is not possible to select objects by their values.
E.g. in the example above, it is possible to formulate a query "give me all users with extension/officeNumber = '111'"
but not "give me all users with extension/favoriteColor = 'green'".

. Indexed items are stored in object's XML representation, as well as in extra columns that
are used for querying objects based on their properties' values.
So they can be used in object queries.

For non-indexed extension items, all data types are supported.

For indexed items, the following types are fully supported:

[%autowidth,cols=3]
|===
h| XML type (Java type)
h| How is it stored in xref:/midpoint/reference/repository/native-postgresql/[Native repository]?
h| How is it stored in xref:/midpoint/reference/repository/generic/[Generic repository]?

| xsd:string (String)
a| stored in `ext` JSONB column as string value
a| table `m_object_ext_string`

| xsd:int (Integer)
.3+a| stored in `ext` JSONB as numeric

This is not JSON/EcmaScript limited number, but virtually limitless PostgreSQL numeric value.
.2+a| table `m_object_ext_long`

| xsd:long (Long)

| xsd:integer (BigInteger)
a| table `m_object_ext_string`: This type is stored as strings because it doesn't fit into "long" type range.
This means that the support is *very limited* and especially comparison operations are not numerically correct!

| xsd:boolean (Boolean)
a| stored in `ext` JSONB as boolean
a| table `m_object_ext_boolean`

| xsd:dateTime (XMLGregorianCalendar)
a| stored in `ext` JSONB as string, formatted as https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601[ISO 8601]
long date and time with `Z` timezone
a| table `m_object_ext_date`

| t:PolyStringType
a| stored in `ext` JSONB as object `{"o":"orig value","n":"normvalue"}`
a| table `m_object_ext_poly`

| c:ObjectReferenceType
a| stored in `ext` JSONB as object `{"o":"oid","t":"type","r":relationUrlId}`,
type uses ObjectType DB enum values, relation is URL ID from `m_uri` table
a| table `m_object_ext_reference`

| enumerations
a| stored in `ext` JSONB as string
a| table `m_object_ext_string`

|===

Java types are mentioned as well, because they are relevant when the real value of the extension
item is used, for instance, in scripting expressions using Groovy.

The default value for `indexed` flag (i.e. the XSD annotation) is `true` for the above supported types,
and it can be switched to `false` if the property is not important for searching.
For other property types, complex types or extension containers (and their content) it is `false`
and cannot be changed to `true`.
It is only possible to search by the properties on the top level of the extension container.

[NOTE]
Word "indexed" here means that the information is externalized in the repository in such a way
that the query against that item is possible.
It does not necessarily mean, that it is well indexed for all supported oprations.
Indexing everything on the DB level for every possible filter type is simply not reasonable,
there are always compromises and specific index can be added for critical queries as needed.
But this always depends on the specific deployment and you should consult your DB admin about it.
Basic cases should be reasonably well indexed out-of-the-box.
See xref:/midpoint/reference/repository/native-postgresql/db-maintenance/#index-tuning[Index tuning] for more information.

The following table lists partially supported types, describing the limitations:

[%autowidth]
|===
| Type | Prism/GUI limitations | Repository support

| xsd:short (Short)
a| Not fully supported by Prism API, no support on GUI.
a| Full support.
Native repo stores it in `ext` JSONB as numeric.

Generic repo stores it in `m_object_ext_long`.

| xsd:decimal (BigDecimal)
a| Not fully supported by Prism API
.3+a| Full support in the Native repo, stored in `ext` JSONB as numeric.

Generic repo stores it in `m_object_ext_string`, because the types do not fit into "long" type range.
This means the support for these types is *very limited*:

* comparisons like "less than", "more than" don't work at all (or provide wrong results),
* equality test is to be used with a great care, as it can provide false negative results (e.g. 0.4999999999 vs. 0.5 vs 0.5000000001).

| xsd:double (Double)
.2+a| No support on GUI.

| xsd:float (Float)

|===

It is recommended to use one of the fully supported types from the first table instead of these types.

=== Using midPoint types

It is possible to define custom attributes using midPoint types.
For example, if there is a need to specify various activation status types for users in your environment, it is possible to define a custom attribute for activation using ActivationStatusType type.
If there is another requirement e.g. for supporting more than one password for the user, ProtectedStringType can be used in such a case.
To allow using of midPoint types, proper schemas have to be added to the extension schema definition using import element as the example below shows:

[source,xml]

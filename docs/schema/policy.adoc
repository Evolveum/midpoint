`PolicyType` is a data type in midPoint schema, meant for objects that contain elements of business or governance policy.

Policy objects usually contain policy rules.
However, they may also be used to build up policy structures, such as classifications and clearances.

Policy objects are usually used as meta-roles.
They contain inducements, usually high-order inducements, which are applied to roles, users, services and other objects using the RBAC mechanisms.
Policy objects technically act almost identically to roles.
However, they have very different meaning and usage.
Therefore, separate data type is created policy objects, to clearly distinguish them from ordinary roles.
Such division is very helpful for presentation (user interface), reporting and general understanding of policy structures.

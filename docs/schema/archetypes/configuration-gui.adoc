This guide helps you work with archetypes in the web administrative user interface of midPoint.

Archetype is a well-defined object subtype.
_Employee_, _Contractor_, _Project_, _Workgroup_, or _Application_ can be archetypes for various classes of objects based on their character.

See xref:/midpoint/reference/schema/archetypes/[] for a more in-depth introduction to the archetype concept.

Refer to xref:./configuration[] for more advanced guides on working with archetypes using XML configuration files.

[NOTE]
====
The list of archetypes you see here is considerably shorter than the list of all available archetypes you see in xref:#list-all-available-archetypes[List All Available Archetypes].
That's because the list here is filtered so that you see only archetypes that can be used for the currently edited object type.

This guide explains how to work with archetypes in the object type resource wizard in midPoint GUI.

== Introduction

When xref:/midpoint/reference/admin-gui/resource-wizard/object-type/[setting up an object type], you can work with archetypes directly from the wizard.

On the *Specify the midPoint data* screen of the object type setup wizard, you can select an existing archetype for the object type, or create a new archetype.

== Select an existing archetype

. Select *Use existing archetype* and click [.nowrap]#icon:arrow-pointer[] btn:[Select archetype]# to pick an existing archetype.
. In the list that appears, click the name of your chosen archetype.
. Click [.nowrap]#icon:check[] btn:[Save settings]# to save your changes and close the wizard.

[NOTE]
====
The list of archetypes you see here is considerably shorter than the list of all available archetypes you see in the xref:../#list-all-available-archetypes[the list of all available archetypes].
That is because the list here is filtered so that you only see archetypes that can be used for the currently edited object type.

== Create a new archetype

Creating a new archetype in the object type wizard creates only a skeleton of an archetype.
When you finish, you may need to tweak its settings using the xref:../#create-an-archetype[full archetype editor].

. Select *Create new archetype* to create a new archetype with basic configuration options.
. You can use *Inherit settings from archetype* if you wish the new archetype to inherit settings from an existing archetype.
. Set names and labels:
	** *Name*: A unique, descriptive, short name.
	** *Description*: A short description of the new archetype.
	** *Label*: A label of the new archetype displayed in the summary panel of objects with this archetype assigned.
	** *Plural label*: A label of the new archetype displayed in the main menu if an object collection view is defined for this archetype.
. Set *Inducement* to _True_ if you wish the archetype to provide the currently edited resource object type to all the focal objects that get this new archetype.
. Click *Display* to expand the section where you can set the archetype icon or color.
	** You can choose *icons* from the link:https://fontawesome.com/search?ic=free[free set of Font Awesome icons].
		Use the names without the `fa-` prefix.
	** *Color* lets you define the archetype color for the icon using CSS color names.
. Click [.nowrap]#icon:check[] btn:[Save settings]# to save your new archetype and changes in the object type, and to close the wizard.

[NOTE]
====
The object type is automatically assigned to the new archetype you have just created.

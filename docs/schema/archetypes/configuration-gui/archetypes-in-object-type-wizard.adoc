On the screen Specify the midPoint data of the object type setup wizard, you can select an existing archetype for the object type, such as _Person_:

. Click icon:arrow-pointer[] btn:[Choose].
. In the list that appears, click the name of your chosen archetype.
. Click the icon:check[] btn:[Save settings] to save your changes and close the wizard.

[NOTE]
====
The list of archetypes you see here is considerably shorter than the list of all available archetypes you see in the xref:../#list-all-available-archetypes[list of all available archetypes].
That's because the list here is filtered so that you see only archetypes that can be used for the currently edited object type.

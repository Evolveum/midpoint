When xref:/midpoint/reference/admin-gui/resource-wizard/object-type/[setting up an object type], you can work with archetypes directly from the wizard.
On the screen Specify the midPoint data of the object type setup wizard, you can select an existing archetype for the object type or create a new one, such as _Person_.

== Select an Existing Archetype

. Select *Use existing archetype* and click icon:arrow-pointer[] btn:[Select archetype] to pick an existing archetype.
. In the list that appears, click the name of your chosen archetype.
. Click the icon:check[] btn:[Save settings] to save your changes and close the wizard.

[NOTE]
====
The list of archetypes you see here is considerably shorter than the list of all available archetypes you see in the xref:../#list-all-available-archetypes[the list of all available archetypes].
That's because the list here is filtered so that you see only archetypes that can be used for the currently edited object type.

== Create a New Archetype

Creating a new archetype in the object type wizard creates only a skeleton of an archetype.
When you finish, you may need to tweak its settings using the xref:../#create-an-archetype[full archetype editor].

. Select *Create new archetype* to create a new archetype with basic configuration options.
. You can use *Inherit settings from archetype* if you wish the new archetype to inherit some settings of an existing archetype, such as _Person_.
. Set names and labels:
	** *Name*: A unique, descriptive, yet short name.
	** *Description*: A short description of the new archetype.
	** *Label*: A label of the new archetype displayed in summary panel of objects with this archetype assigned.
	** *Plural label*: A label of the new archetype displayed in main menu if object collection view is defined for this archetype.
. Set *Inducement* to _True_ if you wish the archetype to provide the currently edited resource object type to all the focal objects that get this new archetype.
. Click *Display* to expand the section where you can set the archetyp icon or color.
	** You can choose *icons* from the link:https://fontawesome.com/search?ic=free[free set of Font Awesome icons].
		Use the names without the `fa-` prefix.
	** *Color* lets you define the archetype color for the icon using CSS color names.
. Click the icon:check[] btn:[Save settings] to save your new archetype, changes in the object type, and close the wizard.

[NOTE]
====
The object type is automatically assigned to the new archetype you just created.

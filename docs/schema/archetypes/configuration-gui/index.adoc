This guide helps you work with archetypes in the web administrative user interface of midPoint.

== Introduction

Archetype is a well-defined object subtype.
_Employee_, _Contractor_, _Project_, _Workgroup_, or _Application_ can be archetypes for various classes of objects based on their character.

See xref:/midpoint/reference/schema/archetypes/[] for a more in-depth introduction to the archetype concept.

Refer to xref:../configuration[] for more advanced guides on working with archetypes using XML configuration files.

== List all available archetypes

There are many predefined archetypes prepared for various uses, such as for users, applications, or tasks.

// * *Create inducement for membership* allows to create an inducement in the new archetype to construct the resource account _and_ association (membership) for focal objects with assigned role of this archetype.
// For example, if you create a new archetype `LDAP group` for roles, by assigning role with `LDAP group` archetype to a user, new LDAP account will be created and made member of the group constructed by `LDAP group` archetype for the role.
// This isn't there but sounds like something that might be useful elsewhere. I just don't yet know where exactly.

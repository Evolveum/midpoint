| Event mark
| Event mark corresponding to the metric row. (If applicable.)

| Explicit metric
| Explicit metric identifier corresponding to the metric row. (If applicable.)

| Selected
| Was this object selected by given metric?
(The meaning of this field is metric-dependent.
The default meaning is "the metric has value greater than zero for this object".)

| Value

(For event marks it is always 0 if not matching or 1 if matching.)

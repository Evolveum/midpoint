# Authenticating with the credentials "administrator" and password "y0uR_P455woR*d" on a localhost instance running on port 8080
curl --user administrator:y0uR_P455woR*d -H "Accept: application/json" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X POST http://localhost:8080/midpoint/ws/rest/resources/ef2bc95b-76e0-59e2-86d6-9999cccccccc/import/AccountObjectClass -v

The response is an HTTP 303 code in case of success *without* a response body. Yet there
is a location header which can be used for a redirect. The object which is referred is a task
used for asynchronous execution of the import operation. Please see xref:/midpoint/reference/interfaces/rest/endpoints/tasks.adoc[this]
link for more information on the tasks endpoint.

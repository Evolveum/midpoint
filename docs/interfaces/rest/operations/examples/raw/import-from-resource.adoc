The response is an HTTP 303 code in case of success *without* a response body. Yet there
is a location header which can be used for a redirect. The object which is referred is a task
used for asynchronous execution of the import operation. Please see xref:/midpoint/reference/interfaces/rest/endpoints/tasks.adoc[this]
link for more information on the tasks endpoint.

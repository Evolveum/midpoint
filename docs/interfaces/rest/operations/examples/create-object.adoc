== Description
Example of creating an midPoint object either representing some identity data in the
form of a new User type object or the creation of a new midPoint resource object.

For the purpose of the sample we are using the CURL tool as it is a well maintained, well
tested, and it's widely accessible.

The body of the request will contain data from an external configuration file,
the data will be inserted into the request via native Curl commands.

xref:/midpoint/reference/interfaces/rest/concepts/authentication/#_basic_authentication[Authentication methods]


[NOTE]
====
If you are using file as a source for the data in the REST call with *curl*, please, don't forget to use '*@*' before the path to your file.

Sometimes the newlines are not correctly handled during the transfer.
(See bug:MID-5229[].) If that occurs, please use `--data-binary`  instead of `-d`.

=== Supported operations

The base URL of REST API is link:http://localhost:8080/midpoint/ws/rest[http://localhost:8080/midpoint/ws/rest] (alternatively to */ws/rest* paths */api/model* and */rest/model* are also supported).

* Use the base URL + path from the table below to request concrete operation.


* Supply the \{type} with the specific type of object you want to add (or modify, delete, [.line-through]#search#, etc).
Supported types are listed xref:/midpoint/reference/interfaces/rest/resource-types/[here]

* Supply the \{oid} with the specific oid of your object.

* Some operations support specifying options influencing the operation execution, e.g. if the execution is made in raw mode, or the shadows are not fetched from the resource, etc.
*Supported options* column shows supported options for different operations.
To specify option, use query parameters, e.g. http://localhots:8080/midpoint/api/model/users*?options=raw*

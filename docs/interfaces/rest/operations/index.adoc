* Use the base URL + path from the table below to request concrete operation.

* Supply the \{type} with the specific type of object you want to add (or modify, delete, [.line-through]#search#, etc).
Supported types are listed xref:/midpoint/reference/interfaces/rest/endpoints/[here]

* Supply the \{oid} with the specific oid of your object.

* Some operations support specifying options influencing the operation execution, e.g. if the execution is made in raw mode, or the shadows are not fetched from the resource, etc.
*Supported options* column shows supported options for different operations.
To specify option, use query parameters, e.g. http://localhots:8080/midpoint/api/model/users*?options=raw*

* The data in the body should be written in one of the  xref:/midpoint/reference/interfaces/rest/concepts/media-types-rest/[supported *Media Types*]

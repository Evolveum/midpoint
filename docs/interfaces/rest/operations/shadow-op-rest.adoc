== Description

A set of operations related specifically to the Shadow object type of midPoint.

== Request

There are multiple possible requests which are specific for the Shadow object type related
operations.

The first operation would be the fetch of the Shadow object (e.g. representing an account) owner
. For this operation you will have to use the HTTP GET method in your request.
The resulting uri could look something like this:

.Get shadow owner operation
[source, http]
----
GET http://localhost:8080/midpoint/ws/rest/shadows/{oid}/owner
----

Another operation is the import of a Shadow object (e.g. again representing an account), thus
either linking them to an existing object in midPoint or creating a midPoint object as a result of this operation.

.Import shadow object
[source, http]
----
POST http://localhost:8080/midpoint/ws/rest/shadows/{oid}/import
----


=== Headers

Regarding authorization type, the "Basic" Authorization header should be used.

.Authorization header example, replace {Base64EncodedCredentials} with the encoded credentials
[source, http]
----
Authorization: Basic {Base64EncodedCredentials}
----

In case of the operations you need to specify the accepted type of content in case
you are interested in a format different from xml (default)

.Accept type header example, other media types are supported as well
[source, http]
----
"Accept: application/json"
----

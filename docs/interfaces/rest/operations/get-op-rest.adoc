== Description

Request for data related to a specific object. The information contains the *properties* and *relations*
of this object as well as metadata and other technical information.

=== Safe Get

HTTP *GET* is a safe operation. The use of GET does not change the state of a web resource.
GET will never cause a (direct) modification. This is given by the REST architectural style.
We consider this to be a very good idea and this approach is adopted by midPoint REST API.

However, object retrieval in midPoint can have side effects.
Maybe midPoint will find out that an account that HTTP GET is trying to retrieve does not exist.
In that case *midPoint consistency mechanism* may be triggered and it can modify the state of the midPoint objects.
Therefore, there may be indirect changes in the objects even if GET is used. However,
those changes are not direct consequence of the GET operation.
Those are consequence of changed environment, and they are only discovered when GET operation is in progress.
Those changes would happen anyway, whether GET is used or not. It just may take a bit longer for midPoint to discover that.
Therefore, we still consider GET to be a safe operation.

If you want to make sure no consistency related change might occur, use the *raw* option set to *true* in your
get queries. As in this example:
[source, http]
----
 http://localhost:8080/midpoint/ws/rest/users/{oid}?options=raw
----


== Request

Use the HTTP GET method with your request.

[source, http]
----
GET http://localhost:8080/midpoint/ws/rest/users/{oid}
GET http://localhost:8080/midpoint/ws/rest/self
----

Additionally, you have to supply header information, and optionally you can also
specify query options as a parameter of your request.

For more information please have a look at the following sections.

=== Headers

Regarding authorization type, the "Basic" Authorization header should be used.

//TODO link na rfc
[source, http]
----
Authorization: Basic {HERE INSERT Base64 Encoded CREDENTIALS}
----

In case of the get operation you often you might like to specify the accepted content type:

[source, http]
----
Accept: application/json
----

For supported media types please refer to the following section of the documentation:

xref:/midpoint/reference/interfaces/rest/concepts/media-types-rest/[Supported Media Types]

=== Body

The get operation does not need to contain any specific payload data in the body of the
request.

=== Options and Functions

Example of usage of options:

//TODO full example
[source, http]
----
?options=raw
----

The *"get"* operations support specifying options influencing the operation execution. You can find the
supported options in these references:

=== Response
The response is a set of identity data describing the fetched object. This example
had some technical information and metadata related to the environment removed before publishing.

== Operation Authorizations
This section refers specifically to *midPoint authorization* configuration,
it represents a set of permissions which is needed for the account accessing the REST interface.
This way midPoint know what actions on which objects is the user permitted to execute.
For more information on midPoint authorizations please see this link.
//TODO add link to authorizations

[NOTE]
====
MidPoint application authorizations may sound similar to the authorization header used in
REST authentication, but they are two distict topics.
====

For following is a simple authorization configuration example.

<role>
    <name>Rest Read All</name>

[WARNING]
====
We do not recommend to use solely the authorization configuration in this example, it is not meant
for production use! Authorization configuration should be more *fine-grained* and *specific
for your use case*.

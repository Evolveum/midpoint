== Description

Request for data related to a specific object. The information contains the *properties* and *relations*
of this object as well as metadata and other technical information.

=== Safe Get

HTTP *GET* is a safe operation. The use of GET does not change the state of a web resource.
GET will never cause a (direct) modification. This is given by the REST architectural style.
We consider this to be a very good idea and this approach is adopted by midPoint REST API.

However, object retrieval in midPoint can have side effects.
Maybe midPoint will find out that an account that HTTP GET is trying to retrieve does not exist.
In that case *midPoint consistency mechanism* may be triggered and it can modify the state of the midPoint objects.
Therefore, there may be indirect changes in the objects even if GET is used. However,
those changes are not direct consequence of the GET operation.
Those are consequence of changed environment, and they are only discovered when GET operation is in progress.
Those changes would happen anyway, whether GET is used or not. It just may take a bit longer for midPoint to discover that.
Therefore, we still consider GET to be a safe operation.

If you want to make sure no consistency related change might occur, use the *raw* option set to *true* in your
get queries. As in this example:

[source, http]
----
 http://localhost:8080/midpoint/ws/rest/{endpoint}/{oid}?options=raw
----

== Request

Use the HTTP GET method with your request.

[source, http]
----
GET http://localhost:8080/midpoint/ws/rest/{endpoint}/{oid}
GET http://localhost:8080/midpoint/ws/rest/self
----

Additionally, you have to supply header information, and optionally you can also
specify query options as a parameter of your request.

For more information please have a look at the following sections.

=== Headers

Regarding authorization type, the "Basic" Authorization header should be used.

.Authorization header example replace {Base64EncodedCredentials} with the encoded credentials
[source, http]
----
Authorization: Basic {Base64EncodedCredentials}
----

To specify the provided content type, please use the "Content-Type" header
payload in the body:

.Content type header example, other media types are supported as well
[source, http]
----
"Content-Type: application/json"
----

You might need to specify the accepted type of content in case
you are interested in a format different from xml (default):

.Accept type header example, other media types are supported as well
[source, http]
----
"Accept: application/json"
----

.For supported media types please refer to the following section of the documentation
xref:/midpoint/reference/interfaces/rest/concepts/media-types-rest/[Supported Media Types]

=== Body

The get operation does not need to contain any specific payload data in the body of the
request.

=== Options and Functions

Example of usage of options:

The *"get"* operations support specifying options influencing the operation execution. You can find the
supported options in these references:

The response is a set of identity data describing the fetched object. This example
had some technical information and metadata related to the environment removed before publishing.

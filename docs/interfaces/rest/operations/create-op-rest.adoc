== Description
Request to create a midPoint object based on data provided in the body of the request.

== Request

Use either the HTTP POST or PUT method with your request. Based on the method used
there are different requirements on the resulting URI:

Using the PUT method, the client has to provide a complete object, including the identifier (OID).

.Create operation using HTTP PUT

----
PUT http://localhost:8080/midpoint/ws/rest/{web_resource_type}/{oid}

If you use the POST method to create new web resources,
you can do this without the need to know the complete URI (i.e. without the oid identifier).

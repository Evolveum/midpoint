== Create With Rest
Request to create a midPoint object based on data provided in the body of the request.

== Request

Use either the HTTP POST or PUT method with your request. Based on the method used
there are different requirements on the resulting URI:

Using the PUT method, the client has to provide a complete object, including the identifier (OID).

.Create operation using HTTP PUT
[source, http]
----
PUT http://localhost:8080/midpoint/ws/rest/{endpoint}/{oid}
----

If you use the POST method to create new web resources,
you can do this without the need to know the complete URI (i.e. without the oid identifier).

.Create operation using HTTP POST
[source, http]
----
POST http://localhost:8080/midpoint/ws/rest/{endpoint}/
----

=== Headers

Regarding authorization type, the "Basic" Authorization header should be used.

.Authorization header example replace {Base64EncodedCredentials} with the encoded credentials
[source, http]
----
Authorization: Basic {Base64EncodedCredentials}
----

In case of the create operation you need to specify the provided content type of the
payload in the body:

.Content type header example, other media types are supported as well

"Content-Type: application/json"

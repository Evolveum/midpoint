*Usage of Exclude*

To exclude an attribute in the output of your request, you can specify
the "exclude" parameter in your query request. The attribute which is
mentioned after the equals sign will be excluded. In case of excluding
multiple attributes, specify each exclude with an "&" character after each
other.

*Example*:

[source,bash]
----
?exclude=metadata&exclude=credentials/password/value
----

*Usage of Operation Options*

To use a boolean based operation option with your request, append a question
mark "?" to the original request URI, then type in the "option=" string
after which you append the name of the option to be used.

Options can be chained with the "&" character if you want to
use multiple options in your request.

*Example*:

[source,bash]
----
?options=raw&options=force
----

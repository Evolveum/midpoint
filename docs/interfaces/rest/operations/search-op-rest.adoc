== Description
As the name implies, the Search operation is used to search for specific objects. This is done with a filter query. In our case
we use a query which is specified in the body of the request (rather than a part of the URI itself).

== Request

The request itself is an HTTP POST operation. The URI contains the endpoint {endpoint} which should be used in the search
and also the */search* keyword.

.Execute the Search request via HTTP POST
[source, http]
----
POST http://localhost:8080/midpoint/ws/rest/{endpoint}/search
----

=== Headers

Regarding authorization type, the "Basic" Authorization header should be used.

.Authorization header example replace {Base64EncodedCredentials} with the encoded credentials
[source, http]
----
Authorization: Basic {Base64EncodedCredentials}
----

To specify the provided content type, please use the "Content-Type" header
payload in the body:

.Content type header example, other media types are supported as well
[source, http]
----
"Content-Type: application/json"
----

You might need to specify the accepted type of content in case
you are interested in a format different from xml (default):

.Accept type header example, other media types are supported as well
[source, http]
----
"Accept: application/json"
----

.For supported media types please refer to the following section of the documentation
xref:/midpoint/reference/interfaces/rest/concepts/media-types-rest/[Supported Media Types]

=== Body

The body consists of a Query in the form of a QueryType type of objects. Please see an example in the *examples* bellow.

=== Options

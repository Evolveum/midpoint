== Description

Modification of objects based on payload data in the body of the REST request.

== Request

Use either the HTTP POST or PATCH method with your request, both usages are equivalent,
this is based on the possibility that not all clients are capable of using non-standard HTTP verbs.

INFO:: The usage of HTTP PATCH is preferred, the meaning is clearer than the case of HTTP POST in the context of Modify.

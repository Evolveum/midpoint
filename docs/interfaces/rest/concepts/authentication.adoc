[TIP]
====
Starting with 4.2 the REST API uses xref:/midpoint/reference/security/authentication/flexible-authentication/[Flexible Authentication] with only Basic Authentication + Impersonation on by default.
SecQ must be added via xref:/midpoint/reference/security/security-policy/[Security Policy Configuration].

[#_basic_authentication]
== Basic Authentication

MidPoint REST interface support standard HTTP basic authentication (RFC2617).
Digest authentication is not supported.

Username and password should correspond to the username and password of appropriately privileged midPoint user.

== Proxy (Impersonation)

There are use cases when the authenticated user is not the user which is supposed to execute the operations in midPoint.
For example a self-service application would like to use the identity of the end user to execute the operations in midPoint.
However, in that case the self-service application would need to know the password of end user.
This approach is neither practical nor secure.
Therefore, this use case is supported by other methods.
The recommended approach is to use a single sign-on (SSO) or similar system to pass end-user identity to midPoint.
OAuth2 is a recommended approach in the case of midPoint REST interface (see below).
However, there are cases when OAuth cannot be used.
The proxy (impersonation) functionality is designed to handle those cases.

The _proxy_ or _impersonation_ is an ability for one user to switch his identity to different user.
In the case of self-service application it works like this:

. Setup: Self-service application will be issued with the application credentials.
There will be an application user in midPoint (e.g. `selfserviceapp` user).
The user will have a strong password which is known to the self-service application.

. End user (`jack`) clicks a button in the self-service application that needs to invoke operation in midPoint.

. Self-service application constructs a REST request to midPoint:

.. The HTTP request will contain standard `Authorization` header with Basic or Digest token.
The token will represent the application user (`selfserviceapp`).

.. The HTTP request will also contain a special header (Switch-To-Principal).
This header refers to the identity of the end user (`jack`).

.. The URL and payload will be set up according to the REST operation.

. MidPoint will authenticate the application user (`selfserviceapp`).

. MIdPoint will extract the end user from the Switch-To-Principal header.

. MidPoint will check whether the authenticated (application) user has proxy authorization that allows switch to the end user.

. If the authorization check is successful midPoint will switch the authenticated identity to the user (`jack`). The operation will be executed using the authorizations of the end user.
The identity of the end user will be recorded in the audit trail.

HTTP header format and example

Header name: *Switch-To-Principal* +
Header value: midPoint oid of the user under which the operation will run +
Example: *-H "Switch-To-Principal: dc12980b-0b92-4c4b-9a4d-f18f70ac977f"* +
Curl example:

[source,bash]
----
curl --user "administrator:y0uR_P455woR*d" -X GET -H "Switch-To-Principal: dc12980b-0b92-4c4b-9a4d-f18f70ac977f" -H "Accept: application/yaml" "http://localhost:8080/midpoint/ws/rest/self" -v
----

Example proxy authorization (which is assigned to the application user such as selfserviceapp) :

[source,xml]
----
<authorization>
  <action>http://midpoint.evolveum.com/xml/ns/public/security/authorization-rest-3#proxy</action>
  <object>
    <type>UserType</type>
    <filter>
        <text>archetypeRef/@/name = "Person"</text>
    </filter>
  </object>
</authorization>
----

The authorization above allows the user to switch identity to any other user who has the archetype `person` assigned.

== Security Questions

Security question authentication is used when "Authorization" header is filled with the value SecQ.
It is expected that the client send all required information for the authentication such as username and list of question identifier and question answer couples.

Prerequisites:

* midPoint is configured to support security question.

* User credentials contains security questions and answers on them.

* REST API call contains "Authorization" header with the value "SecQ" followed with the base64 encoded required information.

Expecting (JSON) format of data sent for SecQ authentication

[source,json]
----
{
  "user" : "administrator",
  "answer" : [
    {
           "qid" : "http://midpoint.evolveum.com/xml/ns/public/security/question-2#q001",
           "qans" : "I don't know!"
     }
  ]
}
----

Example above is the format which is expected for the security question authentication.
Attribute user has to contain username of the user to authenticate.
List of answers has to contain question identifier (`qid` attribute) and question answers (`qans` attribute) couples.
It is sent in the Authorization header encoded in base64 format to the server.

Example curl call:

[source,bash]
----
curl -X GET -H "Authorization: SecQ ew0KInVzZXIiIDogImFkbWluaXN0cmF0b3IiLA0KImFuc3dlciIgOiBbDQogew0KICAgInFpZCIgOiAiaHR0cDovL21pZHBvaW50LmV2b2x2ZXVtLmNvbS94bWwvbnMvcHVibGljL3NlY3VyaXR5L3F1ZXN0aW9uLTIjcTAwMSIsDQogICAicWFucyIgOiAiSSBkb24ndCBrbm93ISINCiB9DQpdDQp9" -H "Content-Type: application/xml" -H "Accept: application/yaml" "http://localhost:8080/midpoint/ws/rest/self" -v
----

=== Challenge - Response implementation (challengeResponseSecQ)

The whole sequence with link:https://httpie.org/[HTTPie] and link:https://linux.die.net/man/1/base64[base64] encoding using command substitution in bash may look like this:

[source,bash]
----
$ http -v :8080/midpoint/ws/rest/self | grep WWW-Authenticate
WWW-Authenticate: Basic realm="internalBasic", SecQ realm="httpSecQ"

# specifying user, response header is "parsed" and decoded
$ http -v :8080/midpoint/ws/rest/self "Authorization: SecQ $(base64 -w 0 <<< '{"user":"administrator"}')" | grep WWW-Authenticate | cut -d' ' -f 3 | base64 -di
{"user":"administrator","answer":[{"qid":"http://midpoint.evolveum.com/xml/ns/public/security/question-2#q001","qtxt":"How much wood would a woodchuck chuck if woodchuck could chuck wood?"},{"qid":"http://midpoint.evolveum.com/xml/ns/public/security/question-2#q003","qtxt":"What's your favorite color?"}]}

# final answer for q001, this shows complete response for "self"
http -v :8080/midpoint/ws/rest/self "Authorization: SecQ $(base64 -w 0 <<< '{"user":"administrator","answer":[{"qid":"http://midpoint.evolveum.com/xml/ns/public/security/question-2#q001", "qans":"much"}]}')"
----

== Other authentication options

Please, consult xref:/midpoint/reference/security/authentication/flexible-authentication/configuration.adoc[Flexible authentication configuration]
for further options, e.g. `httpHeader` for pre-authenticated users.
This allows to delegate authentication to another component, e.g. HTTP server reverse proxy, and implement other types of authentication like OAuth2, SAML, etc.

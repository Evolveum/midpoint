== Description

The MidPoint *REST API* is one of the interfaces which gives you the possibility to
access and interact with the data present in your midPoint instance.

The REST api gives you a feature rich toolset with which you can operate over different
*web resources*, these are represented as specific endpoints to which you send your operation request.

There are many possibilities which we provide in regard to the endpoints you can access. So many
that we have a dedicated page for them.

.To display a *list of REST endpoints* please have a look at:
xref:/midpoint/reference/interfaces/rest/endpoints/[REST Endpoints]

.For a *more technical description* of our REST api please have a look here:
xref:/midpoint/reference/interfaces/rest/concepts/[Concepts]

== How To Use

The *format of the REST request* depends on the type of web resource you try to invoke, the  operation
which you want to execute and any additional options you wish to specify for the request.

.Also, you have to authenticate your self
xref:/midpoint/reference/interfaces/rest/concepts/authentication/#_basic_authentication[Authentication methods]

The most *basic form* of the url request would be:

.Request to read own profile data (raw)
[source,http]
----
GET http://localhost:8080/midpoint/ws/rest/self?options=raw
----
.Request to read own profile data (raw) full example using CURL
xref:/midpoint/reference/interfaces/rest/operations/examples/get-user-self/#_ex_get_own_profile_information_json_raw[Request to read own profile data]

=== Content Type

Please have a look at the following example of a search request (we used curl as a REST client):

include::../rest/operations/examples/raw/search-all-users.adoc[]

By changing the content headers in the request you are capable of using
different formats in the request body. Please see *below* for the
"request" and "return" content.

.For supported media types please refer to the following section of the documentation
xref:/midpoint/reference/interfaces/rest/concepts/media-types-rest/[Supported Media Types]

==== Request Content Types
There are multiple possibilities regarding the content type of the request body and also
regarding the type of data which will be returned to the client.

The content type can be specified inside the URI of the request. This is done via the
addition of a *request header*.

.Content-Type header example, other media types are supported as well
[source, http]
----
"Content-Type: application/json"
----

The following are examples of the content type:

.*Content examples*
[source,xml]
----
<q:query xmlns:q="http://prism.evolveum.com/xml/ns/public/query-3">
    <q:filter>
        <q:text>name startsWith "a"</q:text>
    </q:filter>
</q:query>
----

[source,json]
----
{
  "query": {
    "filter": {
      "text": "name startsWith \"a\""
    }
  }
}
----

[source,yaml]
----
query:
  filter:
    text: "name startsWith \"a\""
----

==== Reply ("Accept") Content Types

You might need to specify the accepted type of content in case
you are interested in a format different from xml (default). This can be done via the "Accept" header

.Accept type header example, other media types are supported as well
[source, http]
----
"Accept: application/json"
----

TIP:: Note the *"Accept: application/xml"* Header usage.

You could have multiple different types of output format:

=== REST Endpoints
Naturally by having a feature rich interface there is no "one size fits them all" way to invoke the operations, so the url will
be different in specific use cases. The most common ones you can see
at xref:/midpoint/reference/interfaces/rest/#_common_use_cases[this] section of the documentation.

The REST interface provides you with a long list of *Endpoints* which you can access. The interface also provides
you with *different kinds of operations*, based on the type of object endpoint you choose.

.*Commonly Used Object Endpoints:*
- xref:/midpoint/reference/interfaces/rest/endpoints/users/[users]
- xref:/midpoint/reference/interfaces/rest/endpoints/roles/[roles]
- xref:/midpoint/reference/interfaces/rest/endpoints/organizational-units/[orgs]
- xref:/midpoint/reference/interfaces/rest/endpoints/resources/[resources]
- xref:/midpoint/reference/interfaces/rest/endpoints/rpc/[rpc]


.The *full collection of Object Endpoints* can be found here:
xref:/midpoint/reference/interfaces/rest/endpoints/[Endpoints]

To ease up the development of you own implementation of a MidPoint REST client. Please
have a look and consider using the midPoint Java Client project:

== Gotchas

=== Storing of Authentication Events

By default, *midPoint stores* the information about *authentication events* of midPoint focus objects.
This behaviour should cause no problem in case of "standard" sing in behaviour of users.
Yet in the case of a service account leveraging the *REST* api, when *large amounts of auhtentication request* might occur, this stored information could build up quite quickly.

Issues which could occur are *prolonged response times* in case of API calls.

The default behaviour of storing such event after each login can be change in midPoint configuration.
Specifically in changing the "*focusBehaviorUpdate*" parameter of a "sequence" of your "securityPolicy".

The possible values are:

* *enabled*: Behaviour attributes will be updated every login.
* *disabled*: Authentication behaviour attributes will not be updated during login.
* *failureOnly*: Authentication behaviour attributes will be updated when login failed and when login will be success,
but previous login was failed and midPoint need update attributes as is number of login fails
and lockout state.

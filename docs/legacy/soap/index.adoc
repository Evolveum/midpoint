== Description

IDM Model Web interface provides unified access to the identity objects stored in the repository and on the resources.
It abstracts away the details about where and how are the data stored, it hides all the low-level system components.

Implementation of this interface are enforcing a consistency of access control decisions and model, e.g. to enforcing Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) and other policies, making sure that the mappings are applied properly, etc.

This a web service version of the IDM Model Interface represented in WSDL.
As such it has some inherent limitations but it is usable for remote access to the Model services.
It also has some operations that are simplified.
For a full-featured native java interface please see the xref:/midpoint/reference/interfaces/model-java/[IDM Model Interface].

Correlation cases in midPoint address scenarios where automated identity matching fails, requiring manual resolution.

== What Is a Correlation Case

When the identity correlation in midPoint can't produce a 100%-certain match between a resource object (like an account) and a corresponding focus object, midPoint creates a case for review.
These correlation cases give you an option to analyze attributes, confirm ownership, or adjust mappings if need be.
This process ensures accurate connections between resource shadow objects and their corresponding focus objects already, which are already linked to other resource object shadows belonging to the same identity.

While still evolving, this feature aligns with the broader case management capabilities for approvals, remediation, and access certification.

.Refer to the following resources for details about correlation and case management:
* xref:/midpoint/reference/correlation[]
* xref:/midpoint/features/planned/manual-correlation/[]
* xref:/midpoint/features/planned/case-management/[]

A common scenario leading to correlation cases is a discrepancy of data between multiple resource:
For example, user having different names or an employee number in the HR system and in another system like an Active Directory or LDAP system.

When it is impossible to find the corresponding focus object for a resource object reliably,
midPoint creates a correlation case with a list of possible candidates.
And that's where you come in.

You inspect the possible candidates for correlation, pick the right match, and correlate the identities manually.
From then on, the identity is bound between the systems.
The logical next step is to correct the data in one of the systems so that both the systems contain accurate data.

== Resolve Correlation Cases

. You can find all cases under icon:case_thick[] *Cases* > icon:case_thick[] *All cases*.
    ** Select any subsection under icon:case_thick[] *Cases* to list cases of a specific category.
. Click the name of the case to open its details:
    ** icon:circle[] *Basic* shows details about the particular case.
    ** icon:circle[] *Correlation* shows you know how closely the resource object shadow and its suggested focal object match.
    ** icon:circle[] *Workitems* is the workbench for correlation cases resolution.
. Check the suggested resource object shadow owners on the icon:circle[] *Workitems* screen.
    ** If any of them is the right one, click the the btn:[Correlate] button in the particular candidate column.
    ** If no suitable owner exists in midPoint, you can btn:[Create new] focal object in midPoint. +
           That's not, however, recommended for cases with authoritative systems like HR systems
           as the focus objects in midPoint should reflect the authoritative system state. +
           It is better to find the root cause of the discrepancy and fix it rather than create new foci arbitrarily.
           This, however, depends heavily on your particular situation, of course.

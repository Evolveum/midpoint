= Smart Correlation
:page-toc: top
:page-upkeep-status: green

== Introduction

The "smart correlation" is a mechanism to correlate identity data to existing focus objects in the repository.
Typical use is e.g. the _resource objects correlation_ during the synchronization process, where (newly discovered) accounts on a resource are synchronized to midPoint.
Another use will be the correlation during manual or automated registration of new users, including self-registration.

The goal for _smart correlation_ is to provide a configurable correlation mechanism that can provide approximate matching.
Then the match can be resolved automatically based on passing defined threshold on level of confidence or it can be resolved manually by a human operator.

== Configuration

The smart correlation mechanism is based on _correlation rules_, technically called _correlators_.
For example, a rule can state that "if the family name, date of birth, and the national-wide ID all match, then the identity is the same".
Another rule can state that "if (only) the national-wide ID matches, then the identity is the same with the confidence level of 0.7" (whatever the number means).

NOTE: In the future, we plan to provide _AI-assisted correlation_ that will suggest correlation candidates also according to human resolution of disputed correlation situations in the history.
At that time, the correlation rules will be not the only - or even not the primary - source for correlation suggestions.
But, currently they are the only driver of the correlation algorithm.

=== Correlation Rule Types

There are the following types of correlation rules:

.Types of correlation rules
[%header]
[%autowidth]
|===
| Type | Meaning
| `items` | Smart xref:/midpoint/reference/correlation/items-correlator/[item-based] correlation rule. The suggested one.
| `filter` | Legacy filter-based correlation rule.
| `expression` | Experimental rule, based on an evaluation of a custom expression.
| `idmatch` | Rule that uses an external link:https://spaces.at.internet2.edu/display/cifer/SOR-Registry+Strawman+ID+Match+API[ID Match] service. Please see xref:/midpoint/projects/idmatch/implementation/implementation/[this document] for more information.
|===

NOTE: Precisely speaking, there is also a `composite` rule that provides an aggregation of the results of its children.
However, currently it is supported only as a top-level rule, i.e., it is present automatically - without the possibility (nor need) to specify it explicitly.

=== Correlation Configuration Placement

The correlation configuration can reside in the following places:

. A resource object type definition: either in top-level `correlation` item, or distributed into individual attribute definitions.
. An object template, currently in top-level `correlation` item.
footnote:[The item-bound usage is planned for the future. It can be configured now, but will not have any effect.]

The reason for such flexibility is that in some scenarios, the correlation is bound to given type of focus objects, regardless of the origin of identity data we need to correlate.
They can come from any resource or (in the future) they may come from registration or self-registration processes.
In other scenarios, though, the correlation rules are specific to given resource object type.

When present, the configuration attached to the resource object type takes precedence over the one connected to the object template.

IMPORTANT: The configuration attached to the object template requires the use of _archetypes_. See <<Limitations>>.

=== Configuration Examples

==== Example 1: Attribute-Bound Definition

The following is the most basic example: an attribute is mapped to a focus property that serves as a correlation item.

.Listing 1. `icfs:name` serving as a correlation attribute
[source,xml]
----
<schemaHandling>
    <objectType>
        ...
        <attribute>
            <ref>icfs:name</ref>
            <correlator/> <!--2-->
            <inbound> <!--1-->
                <target>
                    <path>name</path>
                </target>
            </inbound>
        </attribute>
        ...
    </objectType>
</schemaHandling>
----
<1> Means that the `icfs:name` attribute is mapped to the `name` focus property.
<2> Means that the account is correlated to the focus objects by searching for the corresponding value of `name` property.


If multiple attributes are marked as `correlator`, any of them matching if enough for overall match.
Technically they are evaluated separately; see xref:/midpoint/reference/correlation/rule-composition/[rule composition] for details.
If there is a need of evaluation of two attributes together (meaning that they have to match both), it is necessary to use the explicit xref:/midpoint/reference/correlation/items-correlator/[`items` correlator].

NOTE: The correlation takes place _before_ the regular inbound mappings are evaluated.
That is why there is a special inbound mapping evaluation mode:
xref:/midpoint/projects/idmatch/implementation/correlation-time-mappings/[correlation-time evaluation].
Even though it is turned off by default, the attribute-level `correlator` element automatically turns it on for the selected inbound mapping.


==== Example 2: Resource Object Type Bound Definition

Here we show the same logic defined at the level of the resource object type:

.Listing 2. `icfs:name` serving as a correlation attribute (defined at the level of resource object type)
[source,xml]
----
<schemaHandling>
    <objectType>
        ...
        <attribute>
            <ref>icfs:name</ref>
            <inbound>
                <target>
                    <path>name</path>
                </target>
            </inbound>
        </attribute>
        ...
        <correlation>
            <correlators>
                <items>
                    <item>
                        <ref>name</ref> <!--1-->
                    </item>
                </items>
            </correlators>
        </correlation>
        ...
    </objectType>
</schemaHandling>
----
<1> Declaring the `name` to be the correlation item.

NOTE: Like we have seen in Example 1, mentioning the item `name` as a correlation item enables the correlation-time inbound processing for it.

==== Example 3: Object Template Based Correlation Definition

Finally, this is how the correlation can be defined at the level of an object template.
Here we show a rule requiring that _both_ given name and family name match.

.Listing 3. Correlation defined at the level of object template: requiring a match of both given and family name
[source,xml]
----
<objectTemplate oid="6eb46cb4-d707-4d91-a4ae-1a081bcfe16d" xmlns="...">
    ...
    <correlation>
        <correlators>
            <items>
                <item>
                    <ref>givenName</ref>
                </item>
                <item>
                    <ref>familyName</ref>
                </item>
            </items>
        </correlators>
    </correlation>
</objectTemplate>
----

The correlation-time inbound processing is automatically enabled also in this case.
The object template must be connected to the resource object type via the archetype declared in the object type definition.footnote:[The main reason is that midPoint has to know the archetype _before_ the correlation-time mappings are evaluated.
That's why it is not sufficient if it's determined e.g. during inbound processing.]
An example:

.Listing 4. Connecting an object template to resource object type via an archetype
[source,xml]
----
<resource oid="..." xmlns="...">
    ...
    <schemaHandling>
        <objectType>

            <focus>
                <type>UserType</type>
                <archetypeRef oid="36d04df1-8f81-4442-b576-97b54c716245" />
            </focus>
            ...
        </objectType>
    </schemaHandling>
</resource>

<archetype oid="36d04df1-8f81-4442-b576-97b54c716245" xmlns="...">
    ...
    <archetypePolicy>
        <objectTemplateRef oid="6eb46cb4-d707-4d91-a4ae-1a081bcfe16d"/>
    </archetypePolicy>
    ...
</archetype>
----


==== Example 4: Correlation for outbound resources

Smart correlation relies on inbound mapping converting resource's attribute to a property of midPoint object.
Such approach is perfect for inbound resources because it simplifies the configuration.
Nevertheless, there are use cases with strictly outbound resource with existing accounts that need to be correlater.
In such cases having an inbound mapping is not desired.

For this situation midPoint supports the option to configure mapping for evaluation only for correlation and not for "standard" processing (by clockwork).

.Listing 4. use inbound mapping only for correlation

<schemaHandling>
    <objectType>
        ...
        <attribute>
            <ref>icfs:name</ref>
            <correlator/>
            <inbound>
                <target>
                    <path>name</path>
                </target>
                <use>correlation</use> <!--1-->
            </inbound>
            <outbound> <!--2-->
                ...
            </outbound>
        </attribute>
        ...
    </objectType>
</schemaHandling>
----
<1> Means that the inbound mapping will be used only for correlation and otherwise won't be processed
<2> Represents the outbound mapping as usual

== Advanced Concepts

=== Multiple Correlation Rules

In more complex deployments, there may be multiple correlation rules.
For example, we may want to correlate by given name, family name, date of birth, and national ID using the following rules:

.Sample set of correlation rules
[%header]
[%autowidth]
|===
| Rule# | Situation | Resulting confidence
| 1
| Family name, date of birth, and national ID exactly match.
| 1.0
| 2
| Given name, family name, and date of birth exactly match.
| 0.4
| 3
| The national ID exactly matches.
| 0.4
|===

NOTE: The confidence values are described on xref:/midpoint/reference/correlation/rule-composition/[rule composition] page.

These rules can be configured like this:

.Listing 5. Configuration for the rules 1-3 from Table 2

----
<objectTemplate>
    ...

        <correlators>

                    <ref>familyName</ref>

                <item>
                    <ref>extension/dateOfBirth</ref>
                </item>
                <item>
                    <ref>extension/nationalId</ref>
                </item>
                <composition>
                    <weight>1.0</weight> <!-- this is the default -->
                </composition>
            </items>
            <items>
                <item>

            </items>
        </correlators>
    </correlation>
</objectTemplate>
----

There are a lot of configuration options here.
For example, we can specify the order of rules evaluation and their "A implies B" relations that ensure the correct computation of confidence in case of rule `A` implying rule `B`.
Please see xref:/midpoint/reference/correlation/rule-composition/[rule composition] page for more information.

=== Custom Indexing

IMPORTANT: This feature is available only when using the xref:/midpoint/reference/repository/native-postgresql/[native repository implementation].

Sometimes, we need to base the search on specially-indexed data.
For example, we could need to match only first five normalized characters of the surname.
Or, we could want to take only digits into account when searching for the national ID.

These requirements can be configured like this:

.Listing 6. Examples of custom indexing
[source,xml]

<objectTemplate>
    ...
    <item>
        <ref>familyName</ref>
        <indexing>

                    <polyString> <!--1-->
                        <order>1</order>
                    </polyString>

                        <length>5</length>

                                    basic.stringify(input).replaceAll("[^\\d]", "") <!--4-->
                                </code>
                            </script>

                    </custom>
                </steps>
            </normalization>
        </indexing>
    </item>
    ...
</objectTemplate>
----
<1> Applies the default PolyString normalizer to the original value.
<2> Takes the first 5 characters of the normalized value.
<3> Name by which this normalization can be referenced.
<4> Removes everything except for digits.

These indexes are then used automatically when correlating according to `familyName` and `extension/nationalId`, respectively.

If there are multiple normalizations defined for a given focus item (and none is defined as the default one), we can select the one to be used by mentioning it within the correlation item definition:

Please see xref:/midpoint/reference/correlation/custom-indexing/[custom indexing] and xref:/midpoint/reference/correlation/items-correlator/[`items` correlator] for more information.

=== Fuzzy Searching

By default, the searching is done using "exact match" criteria, either on original values or on the ones that underwent the standard or custom normalization.
Sometimes, however, we want to search for objects that have a property value somewhat similar to the value we have at hand.
For example, we get an account for _Jack Sparrow_, but besides matching users with surname _Sparrow_ we may want to consider also users _Sparow_, _Sparrou_, and so on; although potentially with a lower confidence value.

To do this, a fuzzy search logic was implemented. There are two methods available:

.Fuzzy string matching methods
[%header]
[%autowidth]
|===
| Method | Description
| Levenshtein edit distance
| Matches according to the minimum number of single-character edits (insertions, deletions or substitutions) required to change one string into the other.
(From link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levenshtein_distance[wikipedia].)
| Trigram similarity
| Matches using the ratio of common trigrams to all trigrams in compared strings.
(See link:https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/pgtrgm.html[PostgreSQL documentation on `pg_trgm` module].)
|===

IMPORTANT: The fuzzy search is available only when using the xref:/midpoint/reference/repository/native-postgresql/[native repository implementation].

An example that searches for users having given name and family name close to the provided ones.
The given name has to have Levenshtein edit distance (to the provided one) at most 3.
The family name has to have trigram similarity (to the provided one) at least 0.8.

=== Multiple Identity Data Sources

The advanced correlation needs often go hand in hand with the situations when there are multiple sources of the identity data.
For example, a university may have its Student Information System (SIS) providing data on students and faculty, Human Resources (HR) System keeping records of all staff - faculty and others, and "External persons" (EXT) system for maintaining data about visitors and other persons related to the university in a way other than being a student or employee.

While the data about a person are usually consistent, there may be situations when they differ.
For example, the given name may be recorded differently in SIS and HR systems.
Or the title may be forgotten to be updated in HR.
An old record in the "external persons" system may be out-of-date altogether.

This situation leads to two kinds of requirements:

. When processing data from these systems, midPoint has to somehow decide which ones are "authoritative", that is, which ones to propagate to the "official" user data stored in the repository.
. When correlating, we may want to match data from all systems for the candidate owners.
(Not only the "official" user data.)

MidPoint supports both of them.
For the first one, the engineer must provide an algorithm for determination of the authoritative data source.
The second one is provided transparently, by indexing the data from all the identity sources.

The following example shows how to configure `givenName`, `familyName`, `dateOfBirth`, and `nationalId` as "multi-source" properties.
They are kept separately for each source: SIS, HR, and "external persons" system.
The order of "authoritativeness" (so to say) is: SIS, HR, external, as can be seen in the `defaultAuthoritativeSource` mapping.

== Limitations

As a general rule, when referencing a configuration related to smart correlation (including custom indexing or multi-source processing) in an object template, it must be bound to the resource object type in question via statically-defined archetype (see Listing 3 and 4 in <<Example 3: Object Template Based Correlation Definition>>).

Other limitations are mentioned on pages for individual sub-features:

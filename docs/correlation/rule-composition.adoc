== Correlators (Correlation Rules)

The basic element of the correlation configuration is the definition of _correlation rules_ (or _correlators_).

NOTE: The _correlation rule_ is more user-oriented term, while _correlator_ is more implementation-oriented one.
See also the xref:/midpoint/reference/correlation/[overview document].
Risking a bit of confusion, let us use the term _correlator_ in this document.

Correlators are hierarchical, with a specified default algorithm for combining their results.

NOTE: Currently, we support only the flat hierarchy: a composite correlator defined on top, with component correlators right beneath it.
Please see <<Limitations>> section at the end of this document.

== Confidence Values

The result of the correlator(s) evaluation is a set of _candidates_, each with a _confidence value_.

A confidence value indicates how strongly the correlator(s) believe that this candidate is the one we are looking for.
It is a decimal number from the interval of (0, 1]:
This means that it should be greater than zero (otherwise, the candidate would not be listed at all), and can be as large as 1.
By default, the value of 1 means that the correlator is sure that this is the candidate it has been looking for.

== Composition Algorithm Outline

How is the result determined?

Individual correlators are evaluated in a defined order (see <<Tiers and Rule Ordering>>).

Each correlator produces a set of _candidates_ having zero, one, or more objects.
Each candidate has a (local) _confidence_ value from the interval of (0, 1].
Each correlator has its own _weight_ that is used as a multiplication factor for the local confidence values produced by the correlator.
(For convenience, a global _scale_ can be defined. It can be used to re-scale the confidence values to the interval of (0, 1].)

After the evaluation, a union of all candidate sets is created, and the total confidence for each candidate is computed:

image::confidence-formula.png[Confidence formula,width=600,pdfwidth=50%,scaledwidth=50%]

Where

- _total confidence~cand~_ is the total confidence for candidate _cand_ (being computed),
- _confidence~cand,cor~_ is the confidence of candidate _cand_ provided by the correlator _cor_,
- _weight~cor~_ is the weight of the correlator _cor_ in the composition (it is a parameter of the composition; default is 1),
- _scale_ is the scale of the given composition (it is a parameter of the composition; default is 1).

== A Naive Example

=== Rules

Let us have the following rules:

.Sample set of correlation rules
[%header]
[%autowidth]
|===
| Rule name | Rule content | Weight
| `name-date-id`
| Family name, date of birth, and national ID exactly match.
| 1.0
| `names-date`
| Given name, family name, and date of birth exactly match.
| 0.4
| `id`
| The national ID exactly matches.
| 0.4

=== Example Computation

// Looks like the colors don't work in our generated HTML (yet)

Let us assume we are correlating [blue]`Ian Smith, 2004-02-06, 040206/1328` and the candidate is [blue]`John Smith, 2004-02-06, 040206/1328`.

- The `name-date-id` correlator matches with a local confidence of [blue]*1.0*. Having weight of [red]*1.0*, the overall confidence increment is [purple]*1.0*.
- The `names-date` correlator does not match. Therefore, there is no confidence increment from it.
- The `id` correlator matches with a local confidence of [blue]*1.0*. Having weight of [red]*0.4*, the overall confidence increment is [purple]*0.4*.

The total confidence is [purple]*1.4*, cropped down to [purple]*1.0*.

|===
| Step | Rule | Matching | Local confidence | Weight | Confidence increment | Total so far
| 1. | `name-date-id` | `Smith`, `2004-02-06`, `040206/1328` | 1.0 | 1.0 | 1.0 | 1.0
| 2. | `names-date` | - | - | 0.4 | - | 1.0
| 3. | `id` | `040206/1328` | 1.0 | 0.4 | 0.4 | 1.4 -> 1.0
|===

== "Ignore if Matched by" Flag

After a quick look, we see that the match of the rule `name-date-id` implies the match of the rule `id`.
Hence, each candidate matching `name-date-id` gets a confidence increment *1.4*.
This is, most probably, not the behavior that we expect.
(While not necessarily incorrect, it is quite counter-intuitive.)

Therefore, midPoint has a mechanism to mark rule `id` as _ignored_ for those candidates that are matched by rule `name-date-id` before.

=== Configuration

This is done by setting `ignoreIfMatchedBy` like here:

            <ignoreIfMatchedBy>name-date-id</ignoreIfMatchedBy>
        </composition>
    </items>
</correlators>

=== Example Computation

Now, when correlating `Ian Smith, 2004-02-06, 040206/1328` with the candidate being `John Smith, 2004-02-06, 040206/1328`,

- The `name-date-id` correlator matches with a local confidence of *1.0*. Having weight of *1.0*, the overall confidence increment is *1.0*.
- The `names-date` correlator does not match.
- The `id` correlator matches with a local confidence of *1.0*. However, it is ignored, because of the match of `name-date-id`.

The total confidence is thus `1.0`.

| Step | Rule | Matching | Local confidence | Weight | Confidence increment | Total so far
| 1. | `name-date-id` | `Smith`, `2004-02-06`, `040206/1328` | 1.0 | 1.0 | 1.0 | 1.0
| 2. | `names-date` | - | - | 0.4 | - | 1.0
| 3. | `id` | `040206/1328` | 1.0 | 0.4 | (ignored) | 1.0
|===

== Tiers and Rule Ordering

Looking at our previous example, we feel that after rule `name-date-id` is evaluated and finds exactly one candidate (`John Smith`) with the confidence of *1.0* (certain match), we can stop right there. We don't need to evaluate any other rules.
For such situations, rules can be grouped into _tiers_ and even _ordered_ within them.

In our particular example, we will put the first rule into a separate tier with the number of *1*.
The other rules will be put into tier *2*.

image::tiers.png[Tiers,width=1000,pdfwidth=50%,scaledwidth=50%]

The overall algorithm is the following:

. Tiers are processing sequentially, from the lower numbers to the higher ones. The unnumbered tier - if present - is evaluated last.
. All correlators in a given tier are processed.
Their order can be specified using explicit `order` property (usually need not be used).
Unspecified order means "last".
Correlators with the same order are sorted according to their dependencies given by `ignoreIfMatchedBy` information.
. After each tier is processed, we look if we have exactly one certain candidate. (See <<Using the Resulting Confidence Values>>.)
If we do, we finish the computation.
If there is no certain candidate, we continue.
We continue also in case there are multiple certain candidates, although this situation indicates there is something wrong with the correlation rules.

<1> Tier number for the last tier can be omitted.
<2> The order within the tier (can be ommited).

Note that it is not necessary to specify the last tier, that is number 2 in this case.
It is because unnumbered tier always goes last.

Also, ordering within a single tier is usually not needed.
This case is no exception.
We provide ordering information just as an illustration how it can be done.

=== Example Computation

Now, when correlating `Ian Smith, 2004-02-06, 040206/1328` with the candidate being `John Smith, 2004-02-06, 040206/1328`,

- The `name-date-id` correlator matches with a local confidence of *1.0*. Having weight of *1.0*, the overall confidence increment is *1.0*.
- As this concludes the first tier, and a certain match was found, the processing stops here.

== Using the Resulting Confidence Values

The resulting aggregated confidence values for individual candidates are compared with two _threshold values_:

.Threshold values
[%header]
[%autowidth]
|===
| Value | Description
| Definite match threshold (`DM`)
| If a confidence value is equal or greater than this one, the candidate is considered to definitely match the identity data.
(If, for some reason, multiple candidates do this, then human decision is requested.)
| Candidate match threshold (`CM`)
| If a confidence value is below this one, the candidate is not considered to be matching at all - not even for human decision.
|===

Said in other words:

. If there is a single candidate with confidence value &ge; `DM` then it is automatically matched.
. Otherwise, all candidates with confidence value &ge; `CM` are taken for human resolution.
. If there are none, "no match" situation is assumed.

=== Default values

.Default values for the thresholds
[%header]
[%autowidth]
|===
| Threshold | Default value
| Definite match (`DM`) | 1.0
| Candidate match (`CM`) | 0.0

== Limitations

Although it is possible to configure arbitrary combination of the correlators, and such a combination will most probably work, for practical reasons there are the following limitations of what is "officially" supported. Everything beyond this is considered to be xref:/midpoint/versioning/experimental/[experimental] functionality:

. ID Match correlator cannot be combined with other correlators.
. Filter-based correlators cannot be combined with the other ones.
. Expression-based correlators are experimental altogether.
. Composite correlator can be provided at the top level only.
(It is the implicit instance of the composite correlator that is not visible in the correlation definition.
It is represented by the root `correlators` configuration item.)

Said in other words, only the `items` correlators can be combined.
The use of other ones in the composition is considered experimental.

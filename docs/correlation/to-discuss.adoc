= Things to Be Discussed

. "owner" term - it is too related to the original correlation use case (finding owner for an account)
. even the "correlation" -> do we plan to use this term for the "extended usages" like self-registration?
. name and terminology of the "custom indexing" feature ... e.g., normalization? index?
. unifying normalization steps (polystring, prefix) with expression evaluators?
. should we mark indexing as experimental?
. default names for normalized values: itemName.normalizationName uses dots that aren't recognized by Axiom
. namespace for indexed items

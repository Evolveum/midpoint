This authorization can be used to limit users to access objects only inside their own tenant.
The `includeTenantOrg` element can be used to include or exclude the tenant (tenant org) itself.
E.g. it can be used to prohibit modification of the tenant itself, but allow modification of any other object in its "tenancy".

This authorization works only if both subject and object are multi-tenant.
I.e. it will not work if subject does not have tenant (no `tenantRef`) or in case that the object does not have tenant.
Ordinary (non-tenant) authorizations should be used for those cases.

= Filter Clause

Selects objects that match specified filter.

.Listing 1. Authorization with a selector matching objects that have property `locality` set to value `Caribbean`
[source,xml]
----
<authorization>
    <action>...</action>
    <object>
        <filter>
            <q:equal>
                <q:path>locality</q:path>
                <q:value>Caribbean</q:value>
            </q:equal>
        </filter>
    </object>
</authorization>

The same can be achieved using midPoint Query Language.

.Listing 2. Authorization with a selector matching objects that have property `locality` set to value `Caribbean` (using midPoint Query Language)
[source,xml]

    <object>
        <filter>
            <q:text>locality = "Caribbean"</q:text>

== Expressions

xref:/midpoint/reference/expressions/expressions/[Expressions] can be used in authorization search filters:

[source,xml]
----
<authorization>
    <action>http://midpoint.evolveum.com/xml/ns/public/security/authorization-model-3#read</action>
    <object>
        <type>RoleType</type>
        <filter>
            <q:equal>
                <q:path>roleType</q:path>
                <expression>
                    <!-- Make sure empty value of costCenter does not allow any access. -->
                    <queryInterpretationOfNoValue>filterNone</queryInterpretationOfNoValue>
                    <path>$subject/costCenter</path>
                </expression>
            </q:equal>
        </filter>
    </object>
</authorization>
----

The authorization above allows read access to all roles that have the same `roleType` as is the values of `costCenter` property of the user who is subject of the authorization.

Variable `subject` may be used in the expressions to represent authorization subject (user).
Other common expressions variables may also be available or will be made available in the future.
However, we recommend to avoid using the `actor` variable.
Please use `subject` variable instead.
Those variables are usually set to the same value.
But there may be situations when the value is different (e.g. administrator evaluating authorization of a different user).
The `subject` variable is usually the right one.

[NOTE]
====
Authorizations are evaluated frequently.
Evaluations are done at least twice during ordinary midPoint operation.
Authorizations are designed to be very efficient to evaluate.
However, if expression is part of the evaluation then the expression may impact performance of the entire system.
Expressions that use the `path` evaluator (as the one above) are usually very fast, and they are safe.
Even simple script expressions usually do not create any major issue.
However, try to avoid placing complex or slow expressions into authorizations.
Those are almost certain to have a severe negative impact on system performance.
If you need complex computation, it is perhaps better to compute the value in xref:/midpoint/reference/expressions/object-template/[object template] and place it into property of the object (e.g. user extension property).
Then use only the result of the computation stored in that property in authorization expressions.

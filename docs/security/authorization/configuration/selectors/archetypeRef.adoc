.Listing 1. Authorization applicable to objects with a given archetype.
[source,xml]
----
<authorization>
    <action>...</action>
    <object>
        <archetypeRef oid="00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000321"/>
    </object>
</authorization>
----

Archetype specification is multivalued.
If more than one `archetypeRef` is used in the same authorization, then _or_ operation is implied.
I.e. match of a single archetypes from the list will make the authorization applicable for the object.

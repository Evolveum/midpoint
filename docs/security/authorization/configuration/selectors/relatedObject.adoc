= Related Object Clause

It selects objects (cases, work items) that have a related object which is specified by inner object selector.

An example:

.Listing 1. An authorization allowing reading any case regarding the subject as its object
[source,xml]
----
<authorization>
    <action>http://midpoint.evolveum.com/xml/ns/public/security/authorization-model-3#read</action>
    <object>
        <type>CaseType</type>
        <relatedObject>
            <special>self</special>
        </relatedObject>
    </object>
</authorization>
----

The following behavior applies to midPoint 4.8.

.Supported object types
[%autowidth]
|===
| Object type | What are the assignees?

| `CaseType`
| The `objectRef` value, i.e. the object that the case is concerned with.

| `TaskType`
| The `objectRef` value, i.e. the object that the task acts upon.
(Not supported thoroughly, though.)

== Limitations
. When searching, only `self` selector is supported.

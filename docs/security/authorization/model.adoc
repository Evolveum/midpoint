|===
| Action | Object | Target | Meaning | How it translated to

|  http://midpoint.evolveum.com/xml/ns/public/security/authorization-model-3#read
| Object being read
| N/A
| Read objects
| Allows "read" operations such as `getObject`, `searchObjects`, `countObjects`, ...


| http://midpoint.evolveum.com/xml/ns/public/security/authorization-model-3#add
| New object being added
| N/A
| Add new object
| Allows to invoke `executeChanges` operation with add deltas for specified objects


| http://midpoint.evolveum.com/xml/ns/public/security/authorization-model-3#modify
| Object being modified
| N/A
| Modify existing object
| Allows to invoke `executeChanges` operation with modify deltas for specified objects


| http://midpoint.evolveum.com/xml/ns/public/security/authorization-model-3#delete
| Object being deleted
| N/A
| Delete existing object
| Allows to invoke `executeChanges` operation with delete deltas for specified objects


| http://midpoint.evolveum.com/xml/ns/public/security/authorization-model-3#recompute
| Object being recomputed
| N/A
| Recompute existing object without any requested change
| Allows to invoke `recompute` operation


| http://midpoint.evolveum.com/xml/ns/public/security/authorization-model-3#test
| Resource for which to execute tests
| N/A
| Execute resource connection test
| Allows to invoke `testResource` operation


| http://midpoint.evolveum.com/xml/ns/public/security/authorization-model-3#importObjects
| N/A
| N/A
| Import objects from file or stream (bulk).
This only allows to start the import.
Each individual object also needs to pass through authorization for `add` action.
| Allows to invoke `importObjectsFromFile` and `importObjectsFromStream` operations


| http://midpoint.evolveum.com/xml/ns/public/security/authorization-model-3#importFromResource
| Resource to import from
| N/A
| Import objects from resource.
This only allows to start the import.
Each individual created object also needs to pass through authorization for `add` action.
| Allows to invoke `importFromResource` operation


| http://midpoint.evolveum.com/xml/ns/public/security/authorization-model-3#discoverConnectors
| Connector host on which to start discovery
| N/A
| Discover connectors installed on a specified connector host
| Allows to invoke `discoverConnectors` operation


| http://midpoint.evolveum.com/xml/ns/public/security/authorization-model-3#assign
| xref:/midpoint/reference/schema/focus-and-projections/[Focal object] that receives the assignment (e.g. a user)
| Object which is the target of assignment (e.g. Role or Org)
| Allows to create a new assignment (see note below)
| Allows to invoke `executeChanges` operation with modify deltas for specified objects that add assignment to specified targets


| http://midpoint.evolveum.com/xml/ns/public/security/authorization-model-3#unassign
| xref:/midpoint/reference/schema/focus-and-projections/[Focal object] from which the assignment is removed (e.g. a user)
| Object which is the target of assignment (e.g. Role or Org)
| Allows to delete existing assignment (see note below)
| Allows to invoke `executeChanges` operation with modify deltas for specified objects that add assignment to specified targets


| http://midpoint.evolveum.com/xml/ns/public/security/authorization-model-3#executeScript
| N/A
| N/A
| Allows to execute xref:/midpoint/reference/misc/bulk/[midPoint scripts a.k.a. bulk actions]
| Authorizes only the possibility to execute the scripts, not individual actions carried out by those scripts.
footnote:[For example, if you want to create a set of users via a bulk action, you need both `#executeScript` and `#add` authorizations:
The former to execute the bulk action at all, the latter to allow the bulk action to add the users.
The main purpose of `#executeScript` authorization is to provide a protection against e.g. denial of service attacks based on execution of resource-intensive bulk actions.
Note that the execution of arbitrary Groovy scripts (or Velocity, Python, JavaScript, and similar ones) is _not_ covered by this authorization.
Because of their power, they currently require the super-user ("all") authorization.]
|===

The `assign` and `unassign` authorizations are designed especially to allow assignment and un-assignment of specific roles and orgs, e.g. in cases of delegated administration, multi-tenancy and similar set-ups.
These authorizations are a request-phase replacement for much more powerful `modify` authorization.
E.g. `assign` authorization can be used to allow assignment only selected roles while `modify` authorization can only give blanked permission to modify the `assignment` property.
The `assign` and `unassign` authorizations work only in the request phase.
They are not effective in the execution phase.
Therefore `modify` authorization is still needed in the execution phase.
However as the operation needs to pass both phases to be allowed this is a sufficient set-up.

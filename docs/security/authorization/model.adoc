|===

The `assign` and `unassign` authorizations are designed especially to allow assignment and un-assignment of specific roles and orgs, e.g. in cases of delegated administration, multi-tenancy and similar set-ups.
These authorizations are a request-phase replacement for much more powerful `modify` authorization.
E.g. `assign` authorization can be used to allow assignment only selected roles while `modify` authorization can only give blanked permission to modify the `assignment` property.
The `assign` and `unassign` authorizations work only in the request phase.
They are not effective in the execution phase.
Therefore `modify` authorization is still needed in the execution phase.
However, as the operation needs to pass both phases to be allowed this is a sufficient set-up.

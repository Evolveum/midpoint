To create administrators in midPoint, you need to:

. create a role(s) with required privileges.
You can combine the authorizations specified above.
Although you could add the "Home page" authorization to each role, we prefer and recommend to assign "End User" role to users instead.

. assign the role(s) to midPoint users.
Do not forget to assign "End User" role to allow users to log in to their "Home" tab.

. allow users to log in by setting "Admin GUI Access" to "enabled"

[TIP]
====
Default roles for the most commonly used authorizations will be created and included in midPoint.

= Bulk Actions Authorizations
:page-since: 4.8

Bulk actions are generally considered "safe", as their execution involves checking appropriate authorizations.
For example, if one executes `add` action, the `#add` authorization relevant to object(s) being added is required.

However, to add another layer of security - for example, to prevent denial of service attacks - the mere execution of a bulk action requires a special authorization.

Before midPoint 4.8, it was named `http://midpoint.evolveum.com/xml/ns/public/security/authorization-model-3#executeScript`.
Unfortunately, the name was confusing.
It sounds like the authorization would allow to run Groovy (or Velocity, Python, JavaScript, and similar) scripts, which is not true.
(Because of their power, to run these scripts from bulk actions before 4.8, the `#all` authorization was required.)

Since 4.8, the `#executeScript` authorization is replaced by `http://midpoint.evolveum.com/xml/ns/public/security/authorization-bulk-3#all`.
Furthermore, it is now possible to allow or deny execution of _individual actions_ using authorizations.

For example, if only `http://midpoint.evolveum.com/xml/ns/public/security/authorization-bulk-3#assign` is granted, then only `assign` bulk action can be invoked.

See xref:/midpoint/reference/misc/bulk/index.adoc#_actions[Actions].
The primary names of actions should be used: e.g., `generate-value` (not `generateValue`).

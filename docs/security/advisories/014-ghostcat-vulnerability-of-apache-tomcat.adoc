*Date:* 2 March 2020

*Severity:* Informational

*Affected versions:* all released midPoint versions

*Fixed in versions:* N/A


== Description

Apache JServ Protocol (AJP) of Apache Tomcat may be vulnerable to several types of attack.


== Severity and Impact

This vulnerability does not affect midPoint application per se.
However, it may impact deployment that are not using the xref:/midpoint/reference/deployment/stand-alone-deployment/[stand-alone deployment] model.
Such deployment may use Apache Tomcat servers that may be vulnerable to Ghostcat attacks.


== Mitigation

Mitigation depends on the deployment model:

* Stand-alone deployment of midPoint (default): no need to mitigate.
Stand-alone midPoint deployment is not vulnerable to Ghostcat as AJP connector is not enabled in the embedded Tomcat instance.

* Explicit deployment of midPoint (WAR file): disable or secure AJP connector in your Apache Tomcat instance.

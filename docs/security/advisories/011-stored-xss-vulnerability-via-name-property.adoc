== Description

Stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists in midPoint user interface that can be exploited by manipulation of object 'name' property.


== Severity and Impact

Attacker needs authorization to change object names in midPoint.
Such authorization is usually granted only to administrators and other privileged users.
Only "Repository objects" page is affected.


== Mitigation

Users of affected MidPoint versions are advised to upgrade their deployments to the latest builds from the xref:/midpoint/install/using-support-branch/[support branches].

As this is a medium severity issue, it is not forcing official maintenance releases of midPoint.
However, the fix is provided in all the support branches.


== Discussion and Explanation

The code of "Repository objects" page used wrong method to use object name to construct HTML code of a page.
Therefore this page was vulnerable to the XSS attack.

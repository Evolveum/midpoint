.Test your configuration prior deploying.
WARNING: In case of incorrect loginForm module configuration or in case of its absence, there will be no possibility to login via standard login form again. In that case the user should have another way to restore midPoint environment. +
The emergency `urlSuffix` configuration can help in such case. See xref:#_example_of_sequence_for_administrator_login[example of sequence for administrator login].

== Basic concepts

To better understand the configuration of flexible authentication, it is essential to familiarize ourselves with a few key terms.

=== Authentication module

Authentication modules are the basic building blocks of flexible authentication.
The easiest example of authentication module is the classic login form, found on many websites.
An example is the classic login form found on many websites, which typically includes fields for a username or email and a password.
This login form represents just one authentication module.
There are others like LDAP, HTTP basic authentication, or Identity Provider server authentication, each with its own configuration settings.

=== Authentication sequence and channel

An authentication sequence consists of a chain of authentication modules, each with its specific order and configuration requirements within the sequence. These sequences are defined by channels.

A channel represents a portion of Midpoint for which a particular authentication sequence is applicable. For instance, a channel can be associated with the GUI or a REST service. Additionally, each channel includes a URL suffix, which further specifies when this authentication sequence should be used.

In essence, a channel determines which authentication sequence will be employed for an HTTP request.

Flexible authentication encompasses the following channels:

[%autowidth]
|===
| Request servlet suffix | Channel | Note

|
| http://midpoint.evolveum.com/xml/ns/public/common/channels-3#user
| Default one, represents GUI.
No suffix specified.


| /ws, /rest, /api
| http://midpoint.evolveum.com/xml/ns/public/common/channels-3#rest
|


| /actuator
| http://midpoint.evolveum.com/xml/ns/public/common/channels-3#actuator
|


| /resetPassword
| http://midpoint.evolveum.com/xml/ns/public/common/channels-3#resetPassword
|


| /registration
| http://midpoint.evolveum.com/xml/ns/public/common/channels-3#selfRegistration
|

| /invitation
| http://midpoint.evolveum.com/xml/ns/public/common/channels-3#invitation
|

| /identityRecovery
| http://midpoint.evolveum.com/xml/ns/public/common/channels-3#identityRecovery
|


|===

Channels for _rest_ and _actuator_ default don't create audit records about session creation or termination.
You can turn it on via setting _System Configuration_ ->  _audit_ -> _eventRecording_ -> _recordSessionlessAccess_.


=== Selecting the authentication sequence

We can illustrate the authentication sequence flow with two examples.

==== First example

MidPoint receives an HTTP request with the URL `http://localhost:8080/midpoint/actuator/metrics`.

It extracts the suffix 'actuator' from the URL and by it determines the channel (see table above).
This channel is then used to search for the default authentication sequence associated with that channel.
Once found, midPoint initializes the authentication sequence and, upon successful authentication, sends a request to the actuator service.

==== Second example

In the second scenario, midPoint receives an HTTP request with the URL `http://localhost:8080/midpoint/auth/emergency/users`.

Here, it extracts the 'auth' suffix from the URL, which signifies the use of a specific authentication sequence.
MidPoint then proceeds to search for the appropriate authentication sequence based on the next part of the URL, which, in this case, is 'emergency'.
After successfully authenticating, midPoint sends a request to the service defined in the sequence configuration.
For example, if it is a GUI, the request would be redirected to the users page in the GUI.


== Basic configuration

Flexible authentication is configured in xref:/midpoint/reference/security/security-policy[Security Policy]. Security policy can be defined on different levels.
There is a global level, when the security policy is defined in System Configuration.
Since midPoint 4.7 it is also possible to define security policies for organization unit and archetype.
All security policies applicable for the user are merged together.
The merging is performed after user identification, so after the first module which was able to find a user in the system.

Base tag is _<authentication>_.  Configuration consists of modules and sequences.
Element `module` is basic building block of the configuration.
Each element has a configuration of a particular authentication module instance such as internal password-based authentication, SAML authentication and so on.
Each module specified in the container must have unique identifier.
Element `sequence` defines a sequence of authentication modules.
The modules are invoked in order as they are specified in the sequence.
The purpose of the sequence is to guide user through a complete authentication process.


.Midpoint GUI authentication form
WARNING: In order to utilize the Midpoint GUI, it is necessary to configure an authentication sequence for the `loginForm` module. +
If no authentication is configured in the security policy or if there is no sequence defined in the configured authentication, midPoint will default to using the standard (built-in) login form for user GUI authentication.
However, if there is at least one sequence configured that is not related to loginForm in the authentication configuration, it is imperative to explicitly specify a sequence for the loginForm module in the authentication configuration. This is essential to ensure the proper functioning of the Midpoint GUI. +
To view the default configuration for the loginForm sequence, please refer to the security policy found in the Midpoint initial objects (015-security-policy.xml).

=== Module configuration

The following modules are supported in version 4.8:
`loginForm`, `httpBasic`, `httpHeader`,  `saml2`, `oidc`, `mailNonce`, `smsNonce`, `securityQuestionsForm`, `httpSecQ`, `ldap`, `attributeVerification`, `focusIdentification`, `hint`, `other`, `archetypeSelection`, `correlation`, `duo`.

Each module definition contains following common attributes:

[%autowidth]
|===
| Name | Description | Required | Type | Default

| `identifier`
| Unique identifier of the authentication module.
Short identifier.
It is supposed to give some idea about nature of the module to system administrator.
But it is not supposed to be used as a user-friendly label for the module.
The name is also used in the url, so it should not contain special characters.
| true
| _String_
|

| `description`
| Free form description of the module (administrator comment).
| false
| _String_
|


| `focusType`
| Type of logged object that this authentication module applies to.
E.g UserType, RoleType, OrgType, ...
| false
|

| _UserType_


|===


==== Module loginForm

LoginForm module is used for interactive log-in of a user by using HTML forms.

[#_correlation]
==== Module correlation

Correlation module gives the possibility to find identity(es) (user object(s) for now) in midpoint using xref:/midpoint/reference/correlation/index.adoc[correlation] mechanism within authentication process.
This module is used during xref:/midpoint/reference/security/credentials/identity-recovery/index.adoc[Identity recovery] flow as the second authentication module.

The specified in the module correlators are processed one by one till the only identity is found by the correlators, or till the last correlator is proceeded. In case no identity is found after the last correlator, the list of candidates from the correlators results are considered to be a list of found identities.

===== Generation of service provider metadata
Midpoint can generate metadata of SP. You can get it via link http://<midpointHost>/midpoint/auth/<authenticationSequenceUrlSuffix>/<saml2ModuleName>/metadata/<registrationId>.
RegistrationId is 'aliasForPath', when is provided, or 'alias', when is provided, or 'entityId' of SP.

Generation of metadata works only if your sequence use only saml2 authentication module or saml2 authentication module is first in chain of your sequence. When you want to use a chain and saml2 module won't be first authentication module, we recommend to create sequence only with saml module, generate metadata and then add other modules.

If Midpoint is located behind a reverse proxy it may be useful to set the _publicHttpUrlPattern_ setting to the right value in order for the SAML endpoints (in the SP Metadata and in the SAMLRequest) to reflect the right URLs (see below)

.Example of public URL configuration
[source,xml]
----
<systemConfiguration>

        <publicHttpUrlPattern>https://public.url.local/midpoint</publicHttpUrlPattern>
    </infrastructure>
    .
    .
    .
</systemConfiguration>

===== Migration Saml2 authentication module from 4.3
Dependency for support of `saml2` authentication module was changed to https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-security/tree/main/saml2/saml2-service-provider[Spring Security saml2-service-provider].


* Functionality of a new module is equivalent to the functionality of old `saml2` module, however some configuration properties are not available in the new module.
Such properties were tagged as _deprecated_ in schema of saml2 authentication module.
* Attribute 'provider' has to be changed to 'identityProvider' in 'serviceProvider'.
* When keys of 'type' ENCRYPTION are used, they need to be removed. Service provider will obtain them from metadata for identity provider.

==== Module oidc

MidPoint can write error to log file that some from optional configuration URIs is null and required. This error we can see when 'issuerUri'/.well-known/openid-configuration is unavailable.

*Examples*

The following example shows a simple client secret based authentication against Keycloak.

What is needed to make it work:

. Installed Keycloak e.g. from https://www.keycloak.org/getting-started/getting-started-docker[the Docker image].
In the following we assume it's running on `http://192.168.4.100:8080/`
. Created client `midpoint` (in Keycloak), with client authentication turned on and our midPoint URL (e.g., `http://localhost:8080/midpoint/*`) set as "Valid redirect URI".
. A sample user (e.g. `jack`) created in Keycloak, with a password set.
. The same user created in midPoint, with no password, but some roles (e.g. End user) allowing them to log in.

WARNING: Since version 4.8, the flow for identifying a user logged in via the GUI has been changed. MidPoint uses the claim value with the name from the _nameOfUsernameAttribute_. The claim is primarily obtained from the ID token. When a claim is missing in the ID token, midPoint looks for it in the access token. Finally, if the claim is missing in the access token, midPoint uses the user info endpoint to retrieve the claim. Only the last step applies to Midpoint 4.7

If Midpoint is located behind a reverse proxy it may be useful to set the _publicHttpUrlPattern_ setting to the right value in order for the OIDC Redirect URI to point to a valid public URL (see below).

===== Configuration for REST

Configuration for REST is provided via attribute _resourceServer_, that is type _OidcResourceServerAuthenticationModuleType_. When we want to use OIDC module for REST, midPoint works as resource server. REST request has to contain WWW-Authentication header with syntax `Authorization: Bearer {token}`.

Resource server contains following attributes:

|===

WARNING: Until version 4.8 midPoint needs a JWT to authenticate and identify the midpoint. The configuration attributes used are directly in the OidcResourceServerAuthenticationModuleType.

Since version 4.8, midPoint supports two token formats, JWT (_JwtOidcResourceServerType_) and opaque token (_OpaqueTokenOidcResourceServerType_).

====== JWT format

When we choose the configuration for _jwt_(_JwtOidcResourceServerType_) midPoint obtains a claim, with the name from the _nameOfUsernameClaim_ attribute, from the jwt that is contained in the request.

We have four choices for verification JWT, using issuerUri, JWKSetUri, singleSymmetricKey or using public key, by trustingAsymmetricCertificate or keyStoreTrustingAsymmetricKey.

_JwtOidcResourceServerType_ contains following attributes:

[%autowidth]
|===
| Name | Description | Required | Type

| `realm`
| Realm which Midpoint use for WWW-Authentication header.
| false
| _String_

| `issuerUri`
| Issuer identifier URI for the OpenID Connect provider.
| false
| _String_

| `jwkSetUri`
| URI for the JSON Web Key (JWK) Set endpoint.
| false
| _String_

| `nameOfUsernameClaim`
| Name of claim in JWT, which value define name of user in midPoint.
| _String_

| `singleSymmetricKey`
| Trusting a Single Asymmetric Key.
| false
| _ProtectedStringType_

| `trustedAlgorithm`
| Trusted Algorithms. (RFC7518 section-3.1).
| false
| _String_

| `trustingAsymmetricCertificate`
| Certificate of trusting a single asymmetric RSA public key.
| false
| _ProtectedStringType_

| `keyStoreTrustingAsymmetricKey`
| Key store with trusting a single asymmetric RSA public key.
| false
| _AbstractKeyStoreKeyType_

|===

====== Opaque token format

When we select the configuration for the _opaqueToken_(_OpaqueTokenOidcResourceServerType_) midPoint, we get the claim with the name from the _nameOfUsernameClaim_ attribute from the user info endpoint.

_OpaqueTokenOidcResourceServerType_ contains following attributes:

[%autowidth]
|===
| Name | Description | Required | Type

| `realm`
| Realm which Midpoint use for WWW-Authentication header.
| false
| _String_

| `issuerUri`
| Issuer identifier URI for the OpenID Connect provider.
| false
| _String_

| `nameOfUsernameClaim`
| Name of claim in JWT, which value define name of user in midPoint.
| _String_

| `userInfoUri`
| URI for user info endpoint.
| false
| _String_

But it is not supposed to be used as a user-friendly label.
Sequence name must be unique.
| true
| _String_

| `description`
| Free form description of the sequence (administrator comment).
| false
| _String_


| `channel`
| Specification of channel for authentication sequence.
| false
| _AuthenticationSequenceChannelType_

| Option for updating focus authentication behaviour attributes.
| false
| _FocusBehaviorUpdateType_

|===

==== FocusBehaviorUpdateType

We can enable/disable updating of focus authentication behavior (such as information about last login time) during every login, or we can use option for updating behaviour only when login failed and during success login after failed login. Default value is 'enabled'. Possible values are:

[%autowidth]
|===
| Value | Description

| `enabled`
| Behaviour attributes will be updated every login.


| `disabled`
| Authentication behaviour attributes will not be updated during login.


| `failureOnly`
| Authentication behaviour attributes will be updated when login failed and when login will be success, but previous login was failed and midPoint needs to update attributes as is number of login fails and lockout state.

|===

==== AuthenticationSequenceChannelType

Channel specification for authentication sequence.
It specifies whether this sequence is usable for a specific channel (user/GUI, REST, etc.) _AuthenticationSequenceChannelType_ contains following attributes:

[%autowidth]
|===
| Name | Description | Required | Type

| `channelId`
| Name (URI) of the channel.
| true
| _String_


| `description`
| Free form description (administrator comment).
| false
| _String_


| `default`
| Specifies whether this sequence is the default sequence for a specified channel. +
The default sequence will be chosen in case that specific sequence was not requested, e.g. by using URL suffix.
If this element is not present and only a single sequence is defined for a channel, then such sequence is considered to be the default. +
If more than one sequence is specified then none of them is considered to be default.
In that case this element must be used explicitly.
| false
| _boolean_


| `urlSuffix`
| URL suffix that can be used to select this authentication sequence specifically.
| true
| _String_

|===


==== AuthenticationSequenceModuleType

Specification of authentication module in the sequence.
The authentication modules are evaluated in sequence (or in parallel if possible).
At least one authentication module must succeed for authentication to be successful.
If there are required or requisite modules in the sequence then all of them must succeed for the sequence to be successful.
_AuthenticationSequenceModuleType_ contains following attributes:

[%autowidth]
|===
| Name | Description | Required | Type

| `name`
| Reference to the authentication module name.
Value of this element must match name of existing authentication module.

*`name` attribute is DEPRECATED, use `identifier` instead.*
| true
| _String_

| Ordering number for the module.
The modules are sorted according to those numbers.
| false
| 100


| `necessity`
| Necessity, i.e. the level of requirement, whether the module is mandatory or optional.
We support only SUFFICIENT modules in 4.1.

Since 4.7, supported necessity levels are SUFFICIENT, REQUIRED, REQUISITE, OPTIONAL
| false
| SUFFICIENT

| `acceptEmpty`
| Some modules might be automatically skipped if the concrete type of credentials is not defined.
E.g. if there is no "hint" defined for the user, we can skip evaluation of the hint module.
The same can apply for example for security questions.
In case the module can be skipped, accept empty must be set to `true`. When such module exits and it is skipped, it is marked as CALLED_OFF in the sequence.
| false
| false

|===

There is one hard-coded behavior for modules which defines if the module itself is strong enough for authentication to succeed. FocusIdentification, Hint and AttributeVerification module are three specific modules, which are marked as not enough when exist on their own. Even when the sequence consist of other modules (sufficient) which were evaluated as failed and only those three (combination or one of them) succeed, the result of the authentication is failure.

This configuration allows *emergency backup access* via url /emergency. It accepts only users with role `superuser`.

Example of URL: https://localhost/midpoint/auth/emergency .

[source,xml]
----
<sequence>
    <identifier>admin-gui-emergency</identifier>
    <description>
        Special GUI authentication sequence that is using just the internal user password.
        It is used only in emergency. It allows to skip SAML authentication cycles, e.g. in case
        that the SAML authentication is redirecting the browser incorrectly.

== Necessity Configuration

++++
{% include since.html since="4.7" %}
++++

Each module defined in sequence can define its necessity. Following necessity levels are available:

* `SUFFICIENT` - The module is sufficient for authentication to succeed.
It is NOT required to succeed.
If this module succeeds, the evaluation stops.
The result is a success. Other modules are NOT evaluated.
Except for the case when "required" module that was evaluated before has failed.
If this module fails, the evaluation continues.
Other modules are evaluated.
* `REQUIRED` - The module is required.
The module must succeed for the entire sequence to be successful.
If this module succeeds, the evaluation continues.
Other modules are evaluated.
If this module fails, the evaluation continues.
Other modules are evaluated.
Final result of authentication sequence is a failure.
* `REQUISITE` - The module is required.
The module must succeed for the entire sequence to be successful.
If this module succeeds, the evaluation continues.
Other modules are evaluated.
If this module fails, the evaluation stops with an error.
Other modules are NOT evaluated.
Final result of authentication sequence is a failure.
* `OPTIONAL` - The module is optional.
It is NOT required to succeed.
Optional module does not really influence the result of the authentication.
But it may be used to add some authentication attributes, it may be used to  cross-authenticate is SSO realms and so on.
If this module succeeds, the evaluation continues.
If this module fails, the evaluation continues.
The result of the sequence is a failure only if this is the only module in the sequence, and it fails.

The necessity levels might be combined. E.g. there might be a sequence consisting of three different modules each defined with different necessity level.
The evaluation of the authentication is performed after each module.
If `SUFFICIENT` module is found and its evaluation was successful, all previous modules are checked. In case, all previously `REQUIRED` and `REQUISITE` modules were successful, the authentication ends with the success. If any of them failed, authentication continues. All other modules defined in the sequence are evaluated and the result of the authentication is failure.

If evaluation for `SUFFICIENT` module failed, authentication continues according to the sequence defined. In case, there are `REQUIRED` modules and all of them are successful, despite the `SUFFICIENT` module failed, authentication is evaluated as successful.
Only if the `SUFFICIENT` module is last and its evaluation failed, the whole authentication is evaluated as failed. Last `SUFFICIENT` module in the sequence MUST be successful for authentication to succeed.

If any of the `REQUISITE` modules failed, authentication stops and the result is failure.



== Ignored path Configuration

Tag <authentication> contains tag <ignoredLocalPath>, which defines path without authentication.
For example:

[source]
----
<authentication>
    .
    .
    .
    <ignoredLocalPath>/actuator</ignoredLocalPath>
    <ignoredLocalPath>/actuator/health</ignoredLocalPath>
</authentication>

== Logout

Midpoint supports logout by removing session and data connected with session. Removing session is provided by request to logout by user or termination of session after timeout.

'httpHeader' and 'saml2' authentication modules support sending logout request to logout URL, but only for logout requested by user. For session timeout only its removing is supported.

== Complete Configuration Examples

You can find example on link:https://github.com/Evolveum/midpoint-samples/blob/master/samples/policy/security/security-policy-flexible-authentication.xml[security-policy-flexible-authentication].


== Limitations

Those are the limitations of current implementation of flexible authentication mechanisms.

* Configuration schema for flexible authentication is designed to be mostly complete.
However, not all configuration options are currently supported.

* Social login functionality is not supported yet.

* It is unlikely that midPoint could be used as a member of identity federation directly.
Identity proxy or a similar technology may be needed.

* Support for authentication module _necessity_ is fully supported since 4.8.

* Authentication modules for SOAP web services are not supported because SOAP is deprecated and it will be removed soon.

* REST service supports HTTP basic authentication and OpenID Connect authentication.

* Even though the authentication configuration often suggests that there may be more than one instances of credentials (password, nonce), midPoint currently supports only a single password, single nonce and a single set of security questions.
Multiple credentials are not supported.
The reason for mentioning credential names the configuration schema is to have ability to extend midPoint functionality in the future.

The implementation can be improved in the future.
Please see xref:/midpoint/features/planned/flexible-authentication/[Flexible Authentication Improvements] for the details.

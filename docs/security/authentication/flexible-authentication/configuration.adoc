.Test your configuration prior deploying.
WARNING: In case of incorrect loginForm module configuration or in case of its absence, there will be no possibility to login via standard login form again. In that case the user should have another way to restore midPoint environment. +
The emergency `urlSuffix` configuration can help in such case. See xref:#_example_of_sequence_for_administrator_login[example of sequence for administrator login].

== Selecting the authentication sequence

We can illustrate the authentication sequence flow with two examples.

=== First example

MidPoint receives an HTTP request with the URL `http://localhost:8080/midpoint/actuator/metrics`.

It extracts the suffix 'actuator' from the URL and by it determines the channel (see table above).
This channel is then used to search for the default authentication sequence associated with that channel.
Once found, midPoint initializes the authentication sequence and, upon successful authentication, sends a request to the actuator service.

=== Second example

In the second scenario, midPoint receives an HTTP request with the URL `http://localhost:8080/midpoint/auth/emergency/users`.

Here, it extracts the 'auth' suffix from the URL, which signifies the use of a specific authentication sequence.
MidPoint then proceeds to search for the appropriate authentication sequence based on the next part of the URL, which, in this case, is 'emergency'.
After successfully authenticating, midPoint sends a request to the service defined in the sequence configuration.
For example, if it is a GUI, the request would be redirected to the users page in the GUI.


.Midpoint GUI authentication form
WARNING: In order to utilize the Midpoint GUI, it is necessary to configure an authentication sequence for the `loginForm` module. +
If no authentication is configured in the security policy or if there is no sequence defined in the configured authentication, midPoint will default to using the standard (built-in) login form for user GUI authentication.
However, if there is at least one sequence configured that is not related to loginForm in the authentication configuration, it is imperative to explicitly specify a sequence for the loginForm module in the authentication configuration. This is essential to ensure the proper functioning of the Midpoint GUI. +
To view the default configuration for the loginForm sequence, please refer to the security policy found in the Midpoint initial objects (015-security-policy.xml).

=== Module configuration
Each module definition contains following common attributes:

[%autowidth]
|===
| Name | Description | Required | Type | Default

| `identifier`
| Unique identifier of the authentication module.
Short identifier.
It is supposed to give some idea about nature of the module to system administrator.
But it is not supposed to be used as a user-friendly label for the module.
The name is also used in the url, so it should not contain special characters.
| true
| _String_
|

| `description`
| Free form description of the module (administrator comment).
| false
| _String_
|


| `focusType`
| Type of logged object that this authentication module applies to.
E.g UserType, RoleType, OrgType, ...
| false
|

| _UserType_


|===

=== Sequence Configuration

Sequence contains following attributes:

[%autowidth]
|===
| Name | Description | Required | Type

| `name`
| Unique name of the authentication sequence.
This name is fact a short identifier.
It is supposed to give some idea about purpose of the sequence to system administrator.
But it is not supposed to be used as a user-friendly label.
Sequence name must be unique.

*`name` attribute is DEPRECATED, use `identifier` instead.*
| true
| _String_

| `identifier`
| Unique identifier of the authentication sequence.
Short identifier.
It is supposed to give some idea about purpose of the sequence to system administrator.
But it is not supposed to be used as a user-friendly label.
Sequence name must be unique.
| true
| _String_

| `description`
| Free form description of the sequence (administrator comment).
| false
| _String_


| `channel`
| Specification of channel for authentication sequence.
| false
| _AuthenticationSequenceChannelType_


| `requireAssignmentTarget`
| Required assignment target.
This authentication sequence is applicable only to users that have active assignment with this target (and relation).
If the sequence is attempted on a user that does not have this assignment then the authentication will fail.
| false
| _ObjectReferenceType_


| `nodeGroup`
| Required node group.
This authentication sequence is applicable only to node group that have active assignment with this archetype.
| false
| _ObjectReferenceType_


| `module`
| Specification of authentication module in the sequence.
| true
| _AuthenticationSequenceModuleType_


| `focusBehaviorUpdate`
| Option for updating focus authentication behaviour attributes.
| false
| _FocusBehaviorUpdateType_

|===

==== FocusBehaviorUpdateType

We can enable/disable updating of focus authentication behavior (such as information about last login time) during every login, or we can use option for updating behaviour only when login failed and during success login after failed login. Default value is 'enabled'. Possible values are:

[%autowidth]
|===
| Value | Description

| `enabled`
| Behaviour attributes will be updated every login.


| `disabled`
| Authentication behaviour attributes will not be updated during login.


| `failureOnly`
| Authentication behaviour attributes will be updated when login failed and when login will be success, but previous login was failed and midPoint needs to update attributes as is number of login fails and lockout state.

|===

==== AuthenticationSequenceChannelType

Channel specification for authentication sequence.
It specifies whether this sequence is usable for a specific channel (user/GUI, REST, etc.) _AuthenticationSequenceChannelType_ contains following attributes:

[%autowidth]
|===
| Name | Description | Required | Type

| `channelId`
| Name (URI) of the channel.
| true
| _String_


| `description`
| Free form description (administrator comment).
| false
| _String_


| `default`
| Specifies whether this sequence is the default sequence for a specified channel. +
The default sequence will be chosen in case that specific sequence was not requested, e.g. by using URL suffix.
If this element is not present and only a single sequence is defined for a channel, then such sequence is considered to be the default. +
If more than one sequence is specified then none of them is considered to be default.
In that case this element must be used explicitly.
| false
| _boolean_


| `urlSuffix`
| URL suffix that can be used to select this authentication sequence specifically.
| true
| _String_

|===


==== AuthenticationSequenceModuleType

Specification of authentication module in the sequence.
The authentication modules are evaluated in sequence (or in parallel if possible).
At least one authentication module must succeed for authentication to be successful.
If there are required or requisite modules in the sequence then all of them must succeed for the sequence to be successful.

There is one hard-coded behavior for modules which defines if the module itself is strong enough for authentication to succeed. FocusIdentification, Hint and AttributeVerification module are three specific modules, which are marked as not enough when exist on their own. Even when the sequence consist of other modules (sufficient) which were evaluated as failed and only those three (combination or one of them) succeed, the result of the authentication is failure.

[#_example_of_sequence_for_administrator_login]
.Example of sequence for administrator login
This configuration allows *emergency backup access* via url /emergency. It accepts only users with role `superuser`.

Example of URL: https://localhost/midpoint/auth/emergency .

[source,xml]
----
<sequence>
    <identifier>admin-gui-emergency</identifier>
    <description>
        Special GUI authentication sequence that is using just the internal user password.
        It is used only in emergency. It allows to skip SAML authentication cycles, e.g. in case
        that the SAML authentication is redirecting the browser incorrectly.

===== Necessity Configuration

++++
{% include since.html since="4.7" %}
++++

The necessity levels might be combined. E.g. there might be a sequence consisting of three different modules each defined with different necessity level.
The evaluation of the authentication is performed after each module.

If `SUFFICIENT` module is found and its evaluation was successful, all previous modules are checked. In case, all previously `REQUIRED` and `REQUISITE` modules were successful, the authentication ends with the success. If any of them failed, authentication continues. All other modules defined in the sequence are evaluated and the result of the authentication is failure.

If evaluation for `SUFFICIENT` module failed, authentication continues according to the sequence defined. In case, there are `REQUIRED` modules and all of them are successful, despite the `SUFFICIENT` module failed, authentication is evaluated as successful.
Only if the `SUFFICIENT` module is last and its evaluation failed, the whole authentication is evaluated as failed. Last `SUFFICIENT` module in the sequence MUST be successful for authentication to succeed.

If any of the `REQUISITE` modules failed, authentication stops and the result is failure.



== Ignored path Configuration

Tag <authentication> contains tag <ignoredLocalPath>, which defines path without authentication.
For example:

[source]
----
<authentication>
    <ignoredLocalPath>/actuator</ignoredLocalPath>
    <ignoredLocalPath>/actuator/health</ignoredLocalPath>
    .
    .
    .
</authentication>

= HTTP Session Cookie

MidPoint uses `JSESSIONID` cookie for GUI session identification. `JSESSIONID` cookie is:

 * set when user navigates to midPoint.
 * new value is set when user is logged into midPoint.
 * deleted when user log outs.

== Cookie Attributes

=== HTTPOnly attribute

The `HttpOnly` attribute is used to help prevent attacks such as session leakage, since it does not allow the cookie to be accessed via a client-side script such as JavaScript.

MidPoint sets `HTTPOnly` attribute by default.

=== Path attribute

`path` attribute sets scope of cookie and prevents cookie being sent to other paths on same hosts.

MidPoint by default sets `path` to `/midpoint` to limit cookie scope only to `midPoint`.

=== Secure attribute

The Secure attribute tells the browser to only send the cookie if the request is being sent over a secure channel such as HTTPS.

MidPoint sets `Secure` cookie attribute only if midPoint itself is configured with SSL certificates and connection to midPoint instance uses HTTPS. 

=== SameSite attribute

MidPoint does not set a default value for `SameSite` attribute, since it's use is deployment specific and incorrectly configured `SameSite` attribute may break integration with some SSO providers.


Available values for `SameSite` attribute are:

==== Strict
The `Strict` value is the most restrictive usage of `SameSite`, allowing the browser to send the cookie only to first-party context without top-level navigation. The cookie will not be sent on requests generated by third-party sites.

Since the browser would not send the cookie on any requests generated from a third-party domain or email, the user would be required to sign in again even if they already have an authenticated session.

WARNING: This setting may break integration with some SSO such as OIDC or SAML. 

==== Lax
The `Lax` value is less restrictive than `Strict`. The cookie will be sent if the URL equals to the midPoint (cookieâ€™s) domain (first-party) even if the link is coming from a third-party domain. This value is considered by most browsers the default behavior (if `SameSite` is not set) since it provides a better user experience than the `Strict` value.

==== None
The `None` value specifies that the browser will send the cookie in all contexts, including cross-site requests (the normal behavior before the implementation of `SameSite`). If `SameSite=None` is set, then the `Secure` attribute must be set, otherwise modern browsers will ignore the SameSite attribute, e.g. `SameSite=None; Secure`.

==== Configuring SameSite attribute


`SameSite` attribute can be configured Using `application.yml` in `var` directory.

.Example `var/application.yml` configuraion
[source ,yaml]
----
server:
  servlet:
   session:
     cookie:
       same-site: Strict

== Reverse Proxy

Some deployments opts to use reverse proxy to provide HTTPS and communication between reverse proxy and midPoint is done via HTTP.

In these cases, the reverse proxy should be configured to set cookie attributes:

 * `Secure` - To ensure that cookies are not leaked by request to HTTP port. 
 *  `SameSite` - If there is need  to have different `SameSite` configuration, then for midPoint instance directly or making sure `SameSite` is always present.
 
This configuration is specific to the reverse proxy used, please consult documenation of your reverse proxy.

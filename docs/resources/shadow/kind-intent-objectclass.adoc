Kind, intent and ObjectClass are three terms that are very frequently used in midPoint.
These terms define a type of resource object (or xref:/midpoint/reference/resources/shadow/[shadow]). The _kind_ and _intent_ are midPoint terms.
They define how midPoint is _using_ the object, how midPoint understands its role in the system.
The _objectClass_ is a native type by which the resource recognizes the object.


== Kind, Intent and Tag

MidPoint identifies useful types of resource objects by using a *(kind, intent)* tuple.
I.e. each useful resource object has a *kind* and an *intent*. Kind defines what the object _is_, intent specified how the object _behaves_.


=== Kind

MidPoint supports several *kinds* of resource objects:

* *Account* resource objects represent identity of a person, either physical such as computer user or virtual such as _administrator_, _root_, _daemon_ or similar special-purpose identities.
Accounts can be _xref:/midpoint/reference/roles-policies/assignment/assigning-vs-linking/[linked]_ to the xref:/midpoint/architecture/archive/data-model/midpoint-common-schema/usertype/[User] objects.

* xref:/midpoint/reference/resources/entitlements/[Entitlement] resource objects represent groupings or privileges of an *account*. Entitlement resource objects represent groups, resource-specific roles, access permissions or even organizational unit membership.
Entitlements are *associated* to an *account*.

* Other kinds of resource objects may be introduced later (e.g. organizational unit).

Kind of a resource object is mostly fixed and it is quite difficult to change.
However the kind is usually determined by the fixed type of the object (object class) and does not need to be changed.
The list of resource object kinds is not extensible as their meaning is used in the midPoint IDM logic.


=== Intent

*Intent* of a resource object describes its intended usage.
E.g. users may want to have one _default_ account for normal work, they might have another quite different _admin_ account for system administration and yet another _testing_ account.
The "default", "admin" and "testing" are account intents.
Other IDM systems use the term _account types_ for this, but _intent_ is more generic term and may apply to other resource objects kinds not just accounts (e.g. to entitlements).

Intents are almost entirely custom.
It is expected that intents will be defined specifically for each deployment.
There is only a single standard intent defined: `default`. As the name suggests this is the default intent and it is used if no intent is specified.


=== Tag

++++
{% include since.html since="4.0" %}
++++

_Tag_ is a differentiator for resource object (e.g. accounts) that have the same value of kind and intent.
Tag is used in situations when xref:/midpoint/reference/resources/multiaccounts/[multiple equivalent accounts] are enabled.
Tag is the value that discriminates between such accounts.

Tag is optional.
Accounts that are not used in the "multi" mode do not have any value for tag.


=== Shadow Objects

Kind, intent and tag are stored in xref:/midpoint/reference/resources/shadow/[shadow objects]. Those are midPoint internal concepts.
They are *not* passed to the connector.
They are translated to the _object class_ which is then passed to the connector.


=== Resource Object Discriminator

Tuple (resource, kind, intent, tag) is called _resource object discriminator_ or _resource shadow discriminator_. While this term is almost never seen in midPoint user interface, it can be seen in log files and it is quite an important concept to understand.
The purpose of this discriminator is to distinguish xref:/midpoint/reference/schema/focus-and-projections/[projections]. Each projection linked to a particular focus must have unique value of the discriminator.
MidPoint will generally avoid duplicating the projections.
For example, in case that two _constructions_ use the same combination of (resource, kind, intent, tag) then midPoint assumes that they are referring to the same resource object and such definitions are merged.

It is very important that the discriminator uniqueness is maintained for every focal object.
MidPoint should never create a situation when there is a discriminator duplication.
However, in case that midPoint data are corrupted and there is such a duplication, midPoint will stop the operations with a hard error.


== Object Class

xref:/midpoint/reference/resources/resource-schema/[Object Class] is a type of the object how the _resource_ understands it.
It is therefore a "technical" type of the resource object.
Object classes are defined by the xref:/midpoint/reference/resources/resource-schema/[Resource Schema] and are presented to midPoint by the connector.
MidPoint has a very little control over object classes.
The object classes define a _reality_, what types of objects the resource _can_ handle.
Object classes can reflect the real object class defined by the resource such as `inetOrgPerson` LDAP object class.
Or the object classes can be "virtual" and introduced by the connector such as ConnId `pass:[__ACCOUNT__]` object class (which is presented in midPoint as `ri:AccountObjectClass`).

_Object class_ is a term used by midPoint connectors.
Therefore object class definition is passed to the connector.


== Kind, Intent and Object Class in MidPoint

Object class is what resource understands.
When midPoint reads an object it will know its object class.
If midPoint creates an object it has to define a specific object class.
Therefore object class defines how the object looks like.
However midPoint usually does not know what to do with a specific object class, e.g. an LDAP objectclass `inetOrgPerson`. This object class usually defines an account but the details can vary from deployment to deployment.
Therefore midPoint cannot provide any fixed association between object class and its usage.
Therefore midPoint sorts out the object class to _kind_ and _intent_ as specified above.
While midPoint does not know how to handle objects of object class `inetOrgPerson`, midPoint knows quite well what to do with _default account_ objects.
Default account objects are presented as (kind=account, intent=default) in midPoint.

Therefore midPoint maps object classes to (kind, intent) tuples.
The mapping on the outbound side is defined in xref:/midpoint/reference/resources/resource-configuration/schema-handling/[Resource Schema Handling]. This maps (kind, intent) to object class.
In this case midPoint has a lot of information about the intended use and type of the object in this case and the information is quite reliable.
This configuration can be very declarative and straightforward.
The mapping on the inbound side is defined in xref:/midpoint/reference/resources/resource-configuration/synchronization/[Synchronization Configuration]. This maps object class to (kind, intent) tuple.This mapping is not a very reliable and straightforward because all the midPoint really knows about the object is its object class and attributes.
Therefore this configuration needs to be much more flexible and allow some kind of "guesswork" to correctly sort out the object.

NOTE: See also xref:/midpoint/reference/resources/resource-configuration/schema-handling/changes-in-4.6.adoc[].

== Examples

[%autowidth]
|===
|  | kind | intent | objectClass | Description

| Usual LDAP account
| account
| default
| ri:inetOrgPerson
| The LDAP account that is used for most of the accounts.
The account types that are by default assigned to users.
"Normal" account.
E.g. the mappings can place such accounts into `ou=People,dc=example,dc=com`, use `uid` as naming attribute and so on.
Simply speaking normal account.


| Testing LDAP account
| account
| test
| ri:inetOrgPerson
| The LDAP account used for testing purposes.
As this has a different intent then a different set of mappings can be defined for this account type.
E.g. the mappings may place it in a different `ou`, prefix it with a `TEST` prefix or do any other variation on the definition.


| Legacy LDAP account
| account
| legacy
| ri:person
| The LDAP account using `person` LDAP object class.
This may be used for some legacy applications.
It may (and usually should) have a very different outbound mappings when compared with the default account.


| Usual CSV account
| account
| default
| ri:AccountObjectClass
| Just a simple CSV file account.
The CSV connector does not have a concept of object classes therefore the connector defines only a single virtual  "pass:[__ACCOUNT__]" ConnId object class.


| LDAP group
| entitlement
| group
| ri:groupOfNames
| LDAP group that is normally used for grouping LDAP accounts.
It is using `groupOfNames` LDAP object class.
The outbound mappings may place it in `ou=Groups,dc=example,dc=com` subtree.


| LDAP group (unique)
| entitlement
| group-unique
| ri:groupOfUniqueNames
| Alternative LDAP group that is used by some applications.
It is using `groupOfUniqueNames` LDAP object class.
This may have a different outbound mappings and an entirely different definition.
Therefore midPoint allows the two grouping mechanisms to coexist (and may keep them somehow consistent).


| Custom privilege
| entitlement
| priv
| ri:MiscPrivObjectClass
| Some custom privilege defined in the resource and supported by the connector.

This page describes how to pretend that ordinary read-write resource is in fact read-only.

There are many reasons for this.
But it perhaps is most useful during midPoint setup, testing and migration.
You can test midpoint on real resources by setting them to read-only mode.
You can be sure that midPoint will not destroy the data on the resource even if you have a bug in mappings or make a mistake during a migration procedure.

MidPoint resource can be switched to read-only mode by disabling the resource capabilities that create, modify and delete resource objects.
The capabilities are checked by low-level components of midPoint (in xref:/midpoint/architecture/archive/subsystems/provisioning/[Provisioning Subsystem]) therefore even a severe misconfiguration of high-level midPoint features will not be able circumvent this protection.

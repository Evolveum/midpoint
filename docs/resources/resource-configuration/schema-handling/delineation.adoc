= Resource Object Type Delineation

The `delineation` section is used to specify the set of resource objects that comprise the given resource object type.

The following basic example defines the type of `entitlement/unixGroup` that consists of all objects having the class of `groupOfNames` on a given resource.

    <kind>entitlement</kind>
    <intent>unixGroup</intent>
    <delineation>
        <objectClass>ri:groupOfNames</objectClass>
    </delineation>
</objectType>

Now let us extend the definition to include the base context.

The following configuration restricts the `entitlement/unixGroup` type to objects of `groupOfNames` class that reside within `ou=unixgroups,dc=example,dc=com` organizational unit.

<objectType>
    <kind>entitlement</kind>
    <intent>unixGroup</intent>
    <delineation>
        <objectClass>ri:groupOfNames</objectClass>
        <baseContext>
            <objectClass>ri:organizationalUnit</objectClass>
            <filter>
                <q:text>attributes/dn = "ou=unixgroups,dc=example,dc=com"</q:text>
            </filter>
        </baseContext>
    </delineation>
</objectType>
----

The base context is used to search for objects of `entitlement/unixGroup` type by adding the base context condition to the search query.
However, it can be used also as a _classification rule_ that helps to determine whether an incoming object of `groupOfNames` class belongs to the `entitlement/unixGroup` type or not.

[NOTE]
====
The use of the base context for classification has some restrictions, namely:

. The base context root must be specified by the `equal` filter ('=' sign) with a single value of the type of "LDAP distinguished name".
The fact that it is a distinguished name is determined by the presence of `distinguishedName` matching rule for the attribute.
. The shadow being classified must have a primary or secondary identifier, again with the `distinguishedName` matching rule set.

All delineation configuration items are summarized in the following table.

.List of delineation configuration items
[%header]
[%autowidth]
|===
| Item | Description

| `objectClass`
| Object class (like `ri:inetOrgPerson`) for this resource object type.

| `auxiliaryObjectClass` (multivalued)
| The reference to additional object classes for this object.
The reference should point to object class definition and this definition should be marked as auxiliary.

Definitions of attributes from these classes are "imported" to the object type.
However, currently these auxiliary object classes are _not_ used for classification; i.e. the classification decision is not based on their presence in the specific resource object.

| `baseContext`
| The definition of base context (resource object container).
This object will be used as a base for searches for objects of this type.
Usually only the objects that are hierarchically below the `baseContext` are returned by such a search.
E.g. this is used to specify LDAP `organizationalUnit` that contains users or groups of particular type.
This information is used for object classification as well.
See also `baseContextClassificationUse` property.

| `searchHierarchyScope`
| Definition of search hierarchy scope.
It specifies how "deep" the search should go into the object hierarchy.
It is only applicable to resources that support hierarchical organization of objects (e.g. LDAP resources).
This information is used for object classification (along with `baseContext`) as well.
See also `baseContextClassificationUse` property.

| `filter` (multivalued)
| A filter that defines the object set.
Used for both searching and classification.
Filter(s) specified for a subtype are appended to any filter(s) defined in the supertype.

| `classificationCondition`
| Expression that is evaluated to check whether a resource object is of given type.
It is assumed to return a boolean value.
(If no condition is present then it is assumed to be always true, i.e. the classification is done using the other means.)
It is preferable to use declarative means for classification, i.e. base context and filter(s).

| `classificationOrder`
| In what order should this delineation specification be used for classification?
No value means it should be used at the end.

| `baseContextClassificationUse`
| How should be the base context used for the classification? (See below.)
|===

.The values for `baseContextClassificationUse` property
[%header]
[%autowidth]
|===
| Value | Description
| `required`
| The base context must be used (if it's present in the delineation).
If it cannot be applied, the delineation is considered as non-matching.
| `ifApplicable`
| If the base context is not applicable, it is used.
Otherwise, it is ignored.
This is the default setting.
| `ignored`
| The base context is not used for classification.

== Conditions in Delineation

If it's not possible to use standard means of classification, i.e., specifying the object class, a filter, a base context, and so on, as the last resort one can use the classification condition.

The following code provides a configuration example to check whether the account belongs to the `test` intent.
It checks whether it has the form of `Tnnnnnn` (case insensitive) where `n` is any digit.

[source,xml]
----
<objectType>
    <kind>account</kind>
    <intent>test</intent>
    <delineation>
        <objectClass>ri:AccountObjectClass</objectClass>
        <classificationCondition>
            <variable>
                <name>userId</name>
                <path>$projection/attributes/icfs:name</path>
            </variable>
            <script>
                <code><![CDATA[
                    (userId =~ /^([tT][\d]{6})$/).find()
                    ]]></code>
            </script>
        </classificationCondition>
    </delineation>
----

NOTE: This should be really the last resort.
Specification using filters is strongly recommended, if possible.

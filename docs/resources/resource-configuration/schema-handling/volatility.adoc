= Volatile Attributes and Objects

Volatile attributes are ones that can change on the resource without midPoint initiating (or even knowing about) that particular change.

== Typical Cases

There are several typical cases of volatile attributes.
(Some of these do overlap.)

. Various kinds of default values can be set up on the *object creation*.
An example is Microsoft Exchange e-mail address that may get a default value based on the policies set up by the Exchange administrator.

. An attribute may change unexpectedly *when it's modified* by midPoint.
+
For example, when `SMTP:x@y.z` is added to the list of Exchange addresses, the former primary e-mail alias (marked by `SMTP:` prefix) is automatically downgraded to a secondary alias (marked by `smtp:` prefix).
There is a hidden resource-side processing occurring after the change from midPoint is applied.

. There may be dependencies *between attributes*, e.g., LDAP `uid` may change if the DN changes.

. There may be dependencies *between attributes of related objects*.
For example, let's assume a role has a projection to an LDAP OU and an LDAP group residing in that OU.
When the role is renamed, LDAP OU's distinguished name is changed.
This, however, implicitly changes also the group's DN.

== Configuration Options

=== Attribute-Level Settings

Attribute volatility is specified using the `volatility` item in the attribute definition.

There are two cases here:

. An attribute in question is the volatile one, i.e., it depends on other attributes.
This specified as the *incoming* dependency.
Currently, we can specify only the operation, when this dependency occurs: either `add`, `modify`, or both.
When no operation is specified, both `add` and `modify` are assumed.
+
(Later, it will be possible to provide specific attributes on which this one depends.)

+
An example:

+
.The `uid` attribute depends on unspecified ones, during both `add` and `modify` operations
[source,xml]
----
<objectType>
    <kind>...</kind>
    <intent>...</intent>
    ...
    <attribute>
        <ref>ri:uid</ref>
        ...
        <volatility>
            <incoming>
                <operation>add</operation>
                <operation>modify</operation>
            </incoming>
        </volatility>
    </attribute>
</objectType>
----

. An attribute in question is the volatility source for other (volatile) attributes, i.e., those other attributes depend on it.
This is specified as *outgoing* dependency.
Currently, we specify only the operation here, and only the `modify` operation is supported.
+
(Later, it will be possible to provide specific attributes that depend on this one.)

+
An example:

+
.The `dn` attribute change may trigger changes in other attributes
[source,xml]
----
<objectType>
    <kind>...</kind>
    <intent>...</intent>
    ...
    <attribute>
        <ref>ri:dn</ref>
        ...
        <volatility>
            <outgoing>
                <operation>modify</operation>
            </outgoing>
        </volatility>
    </attribute>
</objectType>
----

+
Note that this is a replacement for (now deprecated) `volatilityTrigger` attribute property.

=== Object-Level Settings

==== The `volatility` Property on the Object Type

Currently, the attribute-level settings may not always be sufficient to ensure correct processing of objects with volatile attributes.

An (experimental) `volatility` object-level property influences processing in the following way:

. If set to `unpredictable`, midPoint reads the current state of the object after any create or modify operation on it.
This should help if the attribute-level volatility is not enough.
(It should be used in addition to it.)

. If set to `explosive`, midPoint invokes full focus recompute/reconcile after the current operation finishes.
This is meant for the hardest situations.
It is quite inefficient.
But it may be the only option to reliably manage data in some resources.

==== The `dataBinding` Property on the Dependency Configuration

For example, the configuration below specifies that `entitlement/group` depends on `entitlement/org` (see case #4 among typical cases).
If `entitlement/org` changes, the `entitlement/group` has to be reloaded, as there is potentially an induced change directly on the resource.

.Attributes in `entitlement/group` depends on the ones in `entitlement/org`
[source,xml]
----
<objectType>
    <kind>entitlement</kind>
    <intent>group</intent>
    ...
    <dependency>
        <kind>entitlement</kind>
        <intent>org</intent>
        <strictness>strict</strictness>
        <dataBinding>some</dataBinding>
    </dependency>
</objectType>
----

== Limitations

The volatile attributes must not deal with any simulated features (like simulated activation) nor associations.

== Introduction

Activation part of resource object type definition is located in xref:/midpoint/reference/resources/resource-configuration/schema-handling/[Resource Schema Handling] part of resource definition.
The activation part defines how the resource object is _activated_, i.e. whether it should or should not exist, whether it should be enabled, disabled or archived, etc.
This part can be used to fine-tune activation and de-activation policies.
E.g. it can be used to specify whether an account should be deleted or disabled when it is unassigned from the user.

The activation part of resource object definition has three parts: existence mapping, administrative status mapping and validity mappings.


== Existence Mapping

The existence mapping determines whether the resource object should exist or not.
If activation mapping returns `true` then the resource object will exist (will be kept as it is or will be created).
If it returns `false` the resource object will not exist (will not be created or will be deleted).

The existence mapping usually uses the concept of _legality_.
The legality is determined by evaluating xref:/midpoint/reference/roles-policies/assignment/[assignments] and the assignment enforcement mode.
The result of such evaluation is provided as `input` to the existence mapping.
Therefore simple `asIs` expression is all that is usually needed:

.asIs existence mapping
[source,xml]
----
<activation>
    <existence>
        <outbound>
            <expression>
                <asIs/>
            </expression>
        </outbound>
    </existence>
   ...
</activation>
----

The mapping above will return `true` if the resource object is legal.
Therefore such object will exist.
It returns `false` if the object is not legal (e.g. there is no assignment for in in FULL assignment enforcement mode).
Therefore such object will be deleted.
This is also the default mapping that will be assumed in case there is no explicit existence mapping specified.

Note that a similar variable is called `assigned`. It is true if and only if there is a valid assignment for this resource object.

In FULL assignment enforcement mode, `assigned` is always the same as `input` (`legal`).
In other enforcement modes, they can be different.
E.g. in RELATIVE mode, a resource object may be legal even if it is not assigned.

|===
| Variable | Type | Description

| `input`
| boolean
| *legality*: set to `true` if the object is legal (based on assignment evaluation and enforcement mode).
See xref:/midpoint/reference/roles-policies/assignment/[Assignment]


| `assigned`
| boolean
| True if there is a valid assignment for this object.


| `focusExists`
| boolean
| Specifies whether the focal object (e.g. user) to which the resource object is linked exists.
Set to `true` if the resource object is linked to an existing focal object.


| `focus`
| FocusType
| Contains the complete focal object (e.g. user)


| `shadow`
| `ShadowType`
| Contains a shadow for which is the existence evaluated (may not be present if not yet created)


|===

[NOTE]
.Weak existence mapping
====
As mappings are concerned the concept of _existence_ of an account is a strange one.
Output (target) of the mapping is not directly bound to any property in the shadow.
It just reflects the state whether the projection should exist or it should not.
Therefore the use of _weak_ mappings is somehow different than in other parts of midPoint.
The target property is virtual and it actually never exists - even if the shadow already exists.
Therefore weak mappings are applied even if the shadow exists, which may be quite counter-intuitive.
But there is an advantage.
Weak mappings will *not* be applied if there is any other non-weak mapping.
Therefore such weak mapping may be used to define a normal state of the account.
E.g. the account should normally exists all the times, even if it is not _legal_.
And then the other mapping may be used to control other or unusual situations.
E.g. we in fact want to delete the account if it is left in illegal state for too long.
Like this:

(if it seems complex, feel free to use xref:#_predefined_activation_mappings[predefined activation mappings] instead)

                        import com.evolveum.midpoint.xml.ns._public.common.common_3.ActivationStatusType
                        import com.evolveum.midpoint.schema.constants.SchemaConstants
                        administrativeStatus == ActivationStatusType.DISABLED &amp;&amp;

----

In this the "default existence" weak mapping is applied in normal circumstances.
This means that the account would exist under normal circumstances.
But if the time constraint and condition in "delayed delete" mapping is evaluated to `true` value then the "delayed delete" mapping is applied instead and the "default existence" is ignored.
Which means that the account gets deleted.

====

[TIP]
====
Although the existence mapping may technically have `inbound` part as well such part is never used.

== Administrative Status Mapping

Administrative status mapping maps xref:/midpoint/reference/concepts/activation/[activation administrative status] from the focal object (user) to the administrative status of resource object.

.administrativeStatus mapping
[source,xml]
----
<administrativeStatus>
    <outbound>
        <expression>
            <asIs/>
        </expression>
    </outbound>
</administrativeStatus>
----

[%autowidth]
|===
| Variable | Type | Description

| `input`
| ActivationStatusType
| *"Magic" computed status* that is most suitable for the account.
It is either an `administrativeStatus` if the resource supports validity time constraints (validFrom, validTo) or it is `effectiveStatus` if the resource does not.
In the later case this effectively simulates the validity time constraints using just the activation status.
Note that since 4.8, the `archived` value is not present here.
It is automatically changed into `disabled`.


| `administrativeStatus`
| ActivationStatusType
| `$focus/activation/administrativeStatus` This may be used to avoid the "magic" computation in the `input` variable and compute the output in a custom way.


| `legal`
| boolean
| *legality*: set to `true` if the object is legal (based on assignment evaluation).
See xref:/midpoint/reference/roles-policies/assignment/[Assignment]


| `assigned`
| boolean
| True if there is a valid assignment for this object.


| `focusExists`
| boolean
| Specifies whether the focal object (e.g. user) to which the resource object is linked exists.
Set to `true` if the resource object is linked to an existing focal object.


| `focus`
| FocusType
| Contains the complete focal object (e.g. user)


|===


== Validity Mappings

In a way similar to the `administrativeStatus`, we can write mappings for `validFrom` and `validTo` - assuming that the resource supports them.

An example that propagates all these three properties to the resource:

[source,xml]
----
<activation>
    <administrativeStatus>
        <outbound>
            <strength>weak</strength>
            <expression>
                <asIs/>
            </expression>
        </outbound>
    </administrativeStatus>
    <validFrom>
        <outbound>
            <strength>weak</strength>
            <expression>
                <asIs/>
            </expression>
        </outbound>
    </validFrom>
    <validTo>
        <outbound>
            <strength>weak</strength>
            <expression>
                <asIs/>
            </expression>
        </outbound>
    </validTo>
</activation>
----

[#_predefined_activation_mappings]
== Predefined activation mappings

NOTE: Since 4.8.

Predefined activation mappings are available since midpoint 4.8.
We can use simple configuration for predefined mappings without long and complicated configuration for existence and administrative mappings.

If an account is unassigned and there is no other existing assignment for an account, midPoint will de-provisioning that account.
Which means that the account will be deleted.
This is the default behavior.
But it can be changed by predefined mappings configuration.

All predefined mapping work only for one purpose.
When we want mapping for administrative status, then we need to add inbound or outbound mapping configuration.

[source,xml]
----
<resource>
    <schemaHandling>
        <objectType>
            ...
            <activation>
                <administrativeStatus>
                    <outbound>
                        <strength>strong</strength>
                        <expression>
                            <asIs/>
                        </expression>
                    </outbound>
                </administrativeStatus>
            </activation>
            ...
        </objectType>
    </schemaHandling>
</resource>
----

Now we can use three predefined configurations.

=== Disable instead of delete
This configuration changes default behavior and account will be disabled instead of being deleted.

[source,xml]
----
<resource>
    <schemaHandling>
        <objectType>
            ...
            <activation>
                <administrativeStatus>...</administrativeStatus>
                <disableInsteadOfDelete/>
            </activation>
            ...
        </objectType>
    </schemaHandling>
</resource>
----

=== Delayed delete
This configuration changes default behavior and account will be deleted with the delay.
Until the account is deleted, it is disabled.

We use `activation/disableTimestamp` from shadow object as reference attribute for time when the account was disabled.
As a disable reason we use de-provision, which means that the assignment for resource was removed from the focus (e.g. user).

[source,xml]
----
<resource>
    <schemaHandling>
        <objectType>
            ...
            <activation>
                <administrativeStatus>...</administrativeStatus>
                <delayedDelete>
                    <deleteAfter>P1M</deleteAfter>
                </delayedDelete>
            </activation>
            ...
        </objectType>
    </schemaHandling>
</resource>
----
We need to set only one attribute `deleteAfter`, that defines time after which the account will be deleted.

=== Pre provision
This configuration will pre-provision a disabled account defined by time before focus’s activation/validFrom date.

[source,xml]
----
<resource>
    <schemaHandling>
        <objectType>
            ...
            <activation>
                <administrativeStatus>...</administrativeStatus>
                <preProvision>
                    <createBefore>-P5D</createBefore>
                </preProvision>
            </activation>
            ...
        </objectType>
    </schemaHandling>
</resource>
----

We need to set only one attribute `createBefore`, that defines time determines how long before date, from activation/validFrom attribute, disabled account will be created.


== Examples


=== Delete on Unassign

This is the default configuration.
It uses only `asIs` mappings.

[source,xml]
----
<resource>
    <schemaHandling>
        <objectType>
            ...

                    <outbound>
                        <expression>
                            <asIs/>
                        </expression>
                    </outbound>
                </existence>
                <administrativeStatus>
                    <outbound>
                        <expression>
                            <asIs/>
                        </expression>
                    </outbound>
                </administrativeStatus>
            </activation>
            ...
        </objectType>
    </schemaHandling>
</resource>
----


=== Disable on Unassign

This configuration does *not* delete accounts when they are unassigned.
It disables them instead.
This is achieved by a combination of existence and administrative status mappings.
In case of unassigned account the existence mapping returns `true` which causes that the account is *not* going to be deleted even if it is not legal.
The administrative status mapping takes care of disabling that account.
It causes that all _legal_ accounts will have the same activation administrative status as the user that they are linked to.
On the other hand all the _illegal_ or _unassigned_ accounts will have `DISABLED` status.

The use of `focusExists` variable in the existence mapping causes that the account will be deleted when a linked user is deleted.
It may be changed to a fixed `true` value if the account should stay there even after the user is deleted.

== Mapping Time Constraints

The xref:/midpoint/reference/expressions/mappings/[Mapping] can optionally have a time constraints.
The time constraints means that the mapping will only be evaluated if certain time constraints are satisfied.
E.g. a mapping that is only evaluated 30 days after the account is disabled.

The time constraints are very useful especially in the activation part of `schemaHandling` definition.
Mapping time constraints can be used to have midpoint do quite a lot of time-related tricks.
E.g. following set of existence mappings will cause that accounts that are disabled for more than one month will be deleted.

Similar mapping time constraints can be used with a negative offset to make something happen before a specific date.

                            The default for account existence in this case is the existence of focus object (user).
                            Is user exists, account should exist too. Also note that this mapping is weak which
                            lets the other mapping to take precedence.

                            The mapping above would cause the account to exist as soon as user appears.
                            But we want to override that and prohibit account existence all the way up to
                            5 days before user's validFrom. This mapping does right that.

                                This condition is not really necessary if all the uses will have a validFrom timestamp.
                                But if there is a user without validFrom then this mapping will be applied
                                indefinitely and the account will never be created. We want to avoid that.

                            This mapping will make sure that if an account is created without a valid assignment
                            (legal=false) then such account will be disabled. We need that because we are pre-provisioning
                            accounts and we want them disabled when they are pre-provisioned.

== Inbound Mappings

The activation state can be synchronized in the opposite direction (i.e., from the resource to midPoint) as well.
xref:/midpoint/reference/expressions/mappings/inbound-mapping/[Inbound mappings] are used to do that.

In the following example,

* the user state from midPoint is synchronized to resource account state (outbound) as is;

* the resource account state is synchronized to midPoint user (inbound) as is but only if the midPoint user state is empty (e.g. for the very first time when you create midPoint user from the resource account).

The resource account will not be authoritative for the account state except the first synchronization.

[NOTE]
====
The `source` and target` parameters of mappings are omitted, because the default ones are applied:

* The outbound mapping has the source of user's `activation/administrativeStatus` property, and the target is the same property of the resource account.
* The inbound mappings has the same, but reversed: source is the resource account's property, target is the user's property.

The `asIs` `expression` is also optional and may be omitted, leading to:

= Attribute Read-Replace Mode

Modifications to this attribute are executed in REPLACE form only.
I.e. if ADD or DELETE VALUE is requested, midPoint will fetch the object state, compute the expected result and write it to the resource object via REPLACE VALUE operation.
This works around some weird connector behavior.

This mode is currently supported for attributes only - not for associations.

*EXPERIMENTAL*. May change in future.

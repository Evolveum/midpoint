= Attribute Matching Rule

Specification of a matching rule for an attribute, overriding a matching rule provided by the connector (if any).
Matching rule is used to compare values of the attribute.
If no matching rule is specified (here or by the connector), midPoint uses the literal comparison which is good for most attribute types and for case-sensitive strings.
An alternative matching rule may be specified e.g. for case insensitive strings.

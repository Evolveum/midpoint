= Exclusive Strong

Normally, the value of an attribute is given by evaluating all normal and strong outbound mappings targeted to it.
(And weak ones, if there's no other value.)

However, there may be situations when we want the strong mapping to take precedence over the normal one(s), just like all of these take precedence over the weak mappings.

Hence, if the `exclusiveStrong` property value is `true`, only the values originating from strong mappings are taken into account.
If the property value is `false` (the default), both strong and normal mapping values are merged to produce the final set of values.

|===
| Logger name | Scope | Recommended log levels | Description | Verbosity

| com.evolveum.midpoint.model.common.mapping.Mapping
| *Mapping Trace*
| TRACE
| Logs summary of execution for each mapping. +
This is quite high-level mapping evaluation.
| Medium

| com.evolveum.midpoint.model.common.expression.Expression
| *Expression Trace*
| TRACE
| Logs summary of expression evaluation. +
This is lower-level trace of the expression with input and output dumps.
It is quite verbose.
| High

| com.evolveum.midpoint.model.common.expression.script.ScriptExpression
| *Script Expression Trace*
| TRACE
| Logs a lot of details about script expression evaluation (Groovy, JavaScript, ...) +
Provides a lot of details
| Very high

| com.evolveum.midpoint.model.impl.lens.projector.Projector
| *Projector Trace*
| DEBUG +
TRACE
| Logs the stages of projector computation.
Especially the TRACE level is very verbose.
However this is the best tool how to troubleshoot problems with synchronization mappings and mapping interactions.
| High

| com.evolveum.midpoint.model.impl.lens.projector
| *Detailed Projector Trace*
| DEBUG +
TRACE
| Logs the stages of projector computation and also the details of each stage.
Especially the TRACE level is extremely verbose.
It could be used in a rare occasions, usually used to diagnose midPoint bugs.
| Nightmare

| com.evolveum.midpoint.model.impl.lens.Clockwork
| *Clockwork Summary*
| DEBUG
| Provides summary of clockwork execution including cause of the events, overview of projector computation and the results (changes).
*Very nice output*. *Recommended for basic troubleshooting*.
| Medium

| com.evolveum.midpoint.model.impl.lens.Clockwork
| *Clockwork Trace*
| TRACE
| Tracing the workings of clockwork (projection, execution, workflow).
It dumps the context between major clockwork stages.
| High

| com.evolveum.midpoint.model.impl.lens.ChangeExecutor
| *Change Executor Trace*
| TRACE
| Logs all changes that clockwork does (User, Accounts, also other objects)
| Medium

| org.identityconnectors.framework
| *Connector Trace*
| TRACE
| Logs all invoked operations executed on all connectors and their return values.
| High

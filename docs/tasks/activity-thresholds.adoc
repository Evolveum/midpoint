Tasks are not xref:/midpoint/reference/schema/focus-and-projections[focus] object (like users, roles, etc.).
This means we cannot use assignments to assign roles with policies like it's described xref:/midpoint/reference/roles-policies/policy-rules/[here].
Activity policies allows us to set constraints and actions directly on task activities.

== Constraints

=== Execution time

The `executionTime` constraint allows us to set a time limit for the activity execution.
There are two options `below` and `exceeds`.
The `below` option is used to set a time limit must exceed, otherwise policy actions will be triggered.
The `exceeds` option the exact opposite/
It is used to set a time limit that must not be exceeded, otherwise policy actions will be triggered.

== Actions

=== Notification

Notification action will send a notification.
Notifications configuration is described xref:/midpoint/reference/misc/notifications[here].

.Example of simple notification configuration for execution time policy action in system configuration
[source, xml]
----
<systemConfiguration xmlns="http://midpoint.evolveum.com/xml/ns/public/common/common-3">
    <!-- more content skipped for brevity -->
    <messageTransportConfiguration>
        <mail>
            <name>mail</name>
            <redirectToFile>/opt/midpoint-home/notifications.txt</redirectToFile>
            <defaultFrom>idm@example.com</defaultFrom>
        </mail>
    </messageTransportConfiguration>
    <notificationConfiguration>
        <handler>
            <simpleActivityPolicyRuleNotifier>
                <transport>mail</transport>
            </simpleActivityPolicyRuleNotifier>
        </handler>
    </notificationConfiguration>
</systemConfiguration>
----

Previous example will send (redirect) notifications to the file `/opt/midpoint-home/notifications.txt`.
Subject and body of the notification can be configured in the `simpleActivityPolicyRuleNotifier` handler.
Default value for `to` field is the task owner `emailAddress` if available.
If owner doesn't have `emailAddress` set, the notification will not be sent.

=== Suspend task

Suspend task action will suspend the task.

        <policy>
            <name>Reconciliation run max. 4 hours</name>

== Limitations

* Activity policies are evaluated only for iterative (plain iterative or search based) activities.
* Activity policies are evaluated before each item processing and after activity completion.

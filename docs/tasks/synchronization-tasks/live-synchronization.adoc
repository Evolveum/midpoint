= Live Synchronization
:toc:

The live synchronization task (or activity) processes a stream of so-called _change events_ coming from a resource.
These events represent changes related to _resource objects_: their creation, modification, or deletion.
The task ensures that these events are processed, so that changes on the resource objects are reflected
on midPoint objects (and propagated to other resources, if needed).

The event stream is requested by midPoint: after a live synchronization activity starts, it asks the resource
for recent changes. Please see a discussion on change token below.

== Basic Configuration

The heart of the configuration is the specification of what xref:/midpoint/reference/tasks/activities/resource-object-set-specification/[resource objects]
we want to synchronize. The `resourceRef` is obligatory, all the other properties are optional. However, usually
the object class is specified as well - either directly, or indirectly via the kind-intent pair. The `query` property
of the object set specification is not applicable for Live synchronization tasks.

=== An example

.Live synchronization task
[source,xml]
----
<task>
    <name>Live synchronization: Example Resource</name>
    <ownerRef oid="00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000002" type="UserType"/>
    <executionState>runnable</executionState>
    <schedule>
        <interval>10</interval>
    </schedule>
    <activity>
        <work>
            <liveSynchronization>
                <resourceObjects>
                    <resourceRef oid="ef2bc95b-76e0-48e2-86d6-3d4f02d3e1a2"/>
                    <objectclass>ri:inetOrgPerson</objectclass>
                </resourceObjects>
            </liveSynchronization>
        </work>
    </activity>
</task>

== Advanced Configuration

Before describing the details, we need to understand what a _change token_ is.

Each change has a token that identifies its position in the stream of events. The token of the last processed event is then
stored in the live synchronization task. It is used when the task is run, in order to obtain a continuation of the change
event stream starting after the last processed event.

Not all resources are capable of providing unique tokens to individual change events. Some of them can e.g. provide common
token value to all changes returned from given `sync()` call. This limits the ability to continue at exactly the position
(in the change event stream) where the processing stopped in case of an error or a task suspension. The ability or inability
of a resource to provide precise token values is described by the `preciseTokenValue` property of the `liveSync` capability.
(See xref:/midpoint/reference/resources/resource-configuration/capabilities/[]).

Currently, e.g. LDAP connector does not generally support precise token values (it does so only in specific cases).
DB Table or SQL Scripting connectors may be able to do that. That way or another, it is the responsibility of the connector
user (i.e. the engineer that configures the resource) to know the behavior of the connector, and to correctly specify this
capability in the resource definition.

=== Token Handling in Dry Run Mode

If the Live synchronization task is run in a dry run mode, the token is not updated by default. This means that after the
task is run again (either in dry run or in full processing mode), the stream of change events is re-processed. This is
the expected behavior: we usually use the dry run mode to check that everything works well, and only after we start
the task in "full" mode.

There may be situations, however, where we need the task to mark events processed in dry run mode as "done"
(by setting the token value appropriately). And this is configured by setting `updateLiveSyncTokenInDryRun` to `true`.

=== Batch Size

The `batchSize` configuration parameter tells midPoint to process only a limited amount of change events in a single
synchronization task run. It can be used e.g. if we want to check the processing of a few events just to see
if everything is OK; or if there is a lot of events waiting, and we want to process them in defined chunks.

So, if a positive value of `N` is specified here, live synchronization fetches at most `N` records during each
runfootnote:[Technically speaking, during a single `provisioning.synchronize()` method execution.].
The unprocessed changes are left for the next task run. (This may change in the future.)

*USE WITH CARE.* This feature assumes that the connector provides LiveSync capability
with `preciseTokenValue` = `true`, i.e. that it assigns sync tokens to individual changes
"incrementally", so it can resume live sync operation on each individual change.

== Error Handling

The default behavior of Live synchronization activity is to _stop_ when an error is encountered.
This is to ensure that no information is lost in such cases. This behavior can be changed via
custom xref:/midpoint/reference/tasks/task-error-handling/[error handling specification].

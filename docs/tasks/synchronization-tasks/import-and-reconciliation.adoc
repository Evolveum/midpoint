= Import and Reconciliation
:toc:

The _import_ task takes a set of resource objects and "pushes" them into midPoint.

The _reconciliation_ task does that as well, but additionally it executes pending (postponed)
operations on the resource objects, and treats objects that no longer appear to be on the resource.

Both kinds of activities update objects in midPoint, and propagate changes to target resources,
if applicable.

[TIP]
====
In addition to running a task, import of individual resource objects can be initiated from midPoint GUI
by clicking the "Import" menu item pages displaying resource objects (accounts, entitlements, or generics).
====

== Basic Configuration

The core of the configuration of both import and reconciliation activity is the specification of what
xref:/midpoint/reference/tasks/activities/resource-object-set-specification/[resource objects] we want to process. We need to know
_both_ `resourceRef` and the object class. The latter can be specified either explicitly by the
object class name, or implicitly by kind-intent pair, or using both, as described
xref:/midpoint/reference/tasks/activities/resource-object-set-specification/[here].

== Some Examples

NOTE: These examples use the new form of task/activity configuration that is available since version 4.4.

This task imports all objects of `inetOrgPerson` class on resource `ef2bc95b-76e0-48e2-86d6-3d4f02d3e1a2`.
Note that here we specify the object class directly by its name.

The following task reconciles all default accounts on resource `ef2bc95b-76e0-48e2-86d6-3d4f02d3e1a2`.
Here the object class is defined indirectly, by specifying `kind` = `account` and `intent` = `default`.
This maps to a specific object class by looking into the resource definition.

Here we can see using a custom query, limiting the number of returned objects to 10.
(This can be useful e.g. to test the import task on a small set of accounts.)

Because `queryApplication` is set to `append`, midPoint takes a query derived from specified `resourceRef`, `kind`, and
`intent`, and _appends_ the given query (containing only `paging` element here) to it. The resulting query is then used
to provide resource objects that are to be imported.

The following task imports all accounts starting with "b" from given resource.

Here we see - again - a combination of implicit query (given by `resourceRef` and `objectclass`) with a custom filter,
specifying that only objects with `ident` starting with `b` should be imported.

== Reconciliation Internals

While the import is quite a simple activity, reconciliation consists of three distinct sub-activities:

[%header]
[%autowidth]
|===
| Identifier | Description
| `operationCompletion` | The eligible pending operations for the given resource are executed.
| `resourceObjects` | Specified set of resource objects is "imported" to midPoint.
| `remainingShadows` | Shadows that were not synchronized in the previous activity are checked.
|===

Now let us describe each of these activities in detail.

=== Operation Completion

Here midPoint scans for shadows on the resource that have any pending operations and tries to finish them.
The operations are executed even if their retry time has not come yet.footnote:[As far as implementation
is concerned, the operation invoked on the shadows found is `provisioning.refreshShadow` with the option
of `forceRetry`.]

[NOTE]
====
Specification of object class, kind, intent, or custom query is ignored. Only `resourceRef` is taken
into account. This behavior may change in the future.
====

=== Resource Objects Processing

Here midPoint issues a search operation against the resource, taking into account specified `objectclass`, `kind`, `intent`,
and `query`. All returned resource objects are processed - in a way very similar to the Import activity.
The differences are:

1. `#reconciliation` channel value is used instead of the `#import` one,
2. internal changes (deltas) used are different: "add" for import, no delta for reconciliation.footnote:[The real effects
of this difference are not clear yet. During import, all the accounts seem to be "just created" (regardless of reality).
During reconciliation, all the accounts seem to be "already existing" (again, regardless of reality). So what really matters
(in both kinds of tasks) is if the corresponding focal objects exist in the repository or not. At least for now.]

=== Remaining Shadows Processing

The previous activity has processed all _existing_ resource objects. This activity deals with objects that existed
before, but do not exist on the resource now.

A special query is issued against all _shadows_ (i.e. against the repository), looking for the ones fulfilling
the following conditions:

1. `resourceRef` and `objectclass` match the values derived from the `resourceObjects` part of the work definition,footnote:[In fact,
kind and intent are checked as well. However, in 4.4 they are not checked during query execution, but right before processing a shadow.
If they do not match, the shadow processing is skipped, so such shadows are visible in activity item processing statistics.]
2. the shadow's last synchronization timestamp (usually `fullSynchronizationTimestamp`) is either null or is older than
the moment when resource objects processing activity has started.

The returned shadows are then checked if they still do exist on the resource. If a shadow is found to be missing,
midPoint invokes the reaction defined for the "deleted" xref:/midpoint/reference/synchronization/situations/[situation],
e.g. disabling, unlinking, or even deleting the focus object.

[NOTE]
====
The following items are currently ignored when looking for not-synchronized shadows:

1. search options,
2. custom query.

So, if a custom query is used, then one must be prepared that this activity will check all objects of given kind/intent/class.
This usually causes no problems, but may mean e.g. longer processing if the set of objects described by the query is significantly
smaller than the unconstrained set.
====

== Advanced Configuration

=== Search Options

It is possible to specify _options_ to be used when searching for resource objects - for both import and reconciliation.
These options can specify e.g. that "no fetch" mode has to be used, or that specific (extra) attributes should be retrieved.
However, there is little practical use of this feature today. In particular, "no fetch" mode has virtually no use here.
Moreover, the application of options during individual reconciliation sub-activities is problematic, because each sub-activity
looks for a different set of objects on a different source (resource or repository).

Overall, we suggest not setting search options for import and reconciliation activities.

=== Custom Query

It is possible to customize the default query generated by `resourceRef`, `kind`, `intent`, and `objectclass` settings.

In theory, it is possible to replace the whole query generated
by custom query. This is driven by setting `queryApplicationMode` to `replace`. However, more practical is to
limit ourselves to just adding clauses to it by using `queryApplicationMode` of `append`.

For import, the interpretation of such a custom query is straightforward.

However, for reconciliation, the query is currently ignored in the first and third sub-activities.
And even if it was not, it's not possible to use attribute filtering there, because the query
is executed against the repository in these cases, not against the resource. (So e.g. attributes - besides
identifiers - cannot be used for filtering.)

Therefore, it is advised to avoid using custom query specification in reconciliation tasks.

=== Selecting Only Specific Sub-Activities

It is possible to run the reconciliation e.g. without the `operationCompletion` activity, or vice versa, with _only_ that
one activity. To achieve that, we can use so-called _activity tailoring_. Some examples:

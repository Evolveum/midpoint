== Import From a Resource

== Simulate Import of a Single Object

Before importing objects, such as accounts, from a resource to midPoint, it's useful to simulate import of a single object to see whether all the mappings behave as expected.

To simulate import of a single account:

. In icon:database[] Resource > icon:database[] All resources, select your resource.
. In the resource-specific left-side menu, select icon:male[] Accounts.
. Pick an account you want to test with
. Click the dropdown menu button btn:[▼] at the far right of the row and select btn:[Import preview].
. In the modal dialog that appears, select the task execution mode:
    ** *Simulated production* if your resource or mappings lifecycle state are in the _Active_ lifecycle state.
    ** *Simulated development* if your resource or mappings lifecycle state are in the _Proposed_ lifecycle state.
. Click btn:[Select]

Once the task finishes, you're taken to the *Processed objects* screen.
There, you see the shadow object with no changes and a new user object that _would_ be added were it not for the simulation.

Click the name of the user object to see its details, mapping results in particular.

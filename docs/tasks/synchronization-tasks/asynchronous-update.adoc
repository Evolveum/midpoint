= Asynchronous Update
:toc:
:page-experimental: true

The asynchronous update activity/task processes a stream of so-called _change events_ coming from a resource.
These events represent changes related to _resource objects_: their creation, modification, or deletion.
The task ensures that these events are processed, so that changes on the resource objects are reflected
on midPoint objects (and propagated to other resources, if needed).

Unlike xref:../live-synchronization/[live synchronization], these change events are sent to midPoint asynchronously,
i.e. the transfer is driven by the resource, not by midPoint.

== Basic Configuration

The heart of the configuration is the specification of what xref:/midpoint/reference/tasks/activities/resource-object-set-specification/[resource objects]
we want to process updates for. The `resourceRef` is obligatory, all the other properties are ignored (for now).

=== An example

.Asynchronous update task
[source,xml]
----
<task>
    <name>Asynchronous update: Example Resource</name>
    <ownerRef oid="00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000002" type="UserType"/>
    <executionState>runnable</executionState>
    <activity>
        <work>
            <asynchronousUpdate>
                <updatedResourceObjects>
                    <resourceRef oid="54102823-84c3-49f0-a350-3b5514c9b7b9"/>
                </updatedResourceObjects>
            </asynchronousUpdate>
        </work>
    </activity>
</task>

== Advanced Configuration

== Error Handling

The default behavior of Asynchronous update activity is to _stop_ when an error is encountered.
This is to ensure that no information is lost in such cases. This behavior can be changed via
custom xref:/midpoint/reference/tasks/task-error-handling/[error handling specification].

:page-nav-title: Shadow Reclassification Task in GUI

This guide helps you work with shadow reclassification tasks in the web administrative user interface of midPoint.

MidPoint classifies shadow objects found on a resource by assigning them a kind and intent. This classification is necessary for midPoint to work with the objects. The classification may need to be adjusted, especially after changes to the xref:/midpoint/reference/admin-gui/resource-wizard/object-type/#specify-the-resource-data[resource object type configuration], such as filtering. That's what shadow reclassification tasks are for. This guide describes how to work with these tasks in the midPoint GUI.

See xref:/midpoint/reference/tasks/shadow-reclassification-task/[] for a more in-depth introduction to the shadow reclassification.

.Resource objects vs. accounts
[NOTE]
====
There are two items in the resource navigation menu that may display confusingly similar contents: Resource objects and Accounts.
However, they're not the same and they're very useful when adjusting object types classification.

* The *Resource objects* section lists all objects found on the resource that are of the object class selected at the top of the list, regardless of any object type filtering.
* The *Accounts* section lists account shadows created based on the overal resource object type setup, including the filtering rules.
    This is the section where you see results of the filtering rules you set in the resource object type configuration.
    Once you run shadow reclassification task, contents of this section reflect your updates to resource data filtering. The Resource objects section contents stay the same.

== Reclassify Shadows after Object Type Changes

Firstly, select your resource under icon:database[] *Resources* > icon:database[] *All resources* and xref:/midpoint/reference/admin-gui/resource-wizard/object-type/#specify-the-resource-data[make your changes to the object type].

Once you're done with the changes to the object type:

. In the left-side resource menu, select icon:eye[] *Resource objects*.
. Click icon:tasks[] *Tasks* > icon:plus-circle[] *Create task*.
. In the modal dialog that appears, there's only one task type to choose from. +
    Optionally, activate xref:/midpoint/reference/simulation/[simulation] using the *Simulate task* toggle to see which objects would be reclassified and how before you run the actual reclassification.
. Click icon:plus-circle[] btn:[Create task].
. *Configuration* screen:
    .. Fill in the *Name* of the task, e.g., _HR Person Shadow Reclassification_.
    .. Click btn:[Next: Resource objects].
. *Resource objects* screen:
    .. As long as the correct *Object class* is pre-selected, keep the defaults. +
        Otherwise, select the right resource and specify the target object type either by the object class, or by the kind―intent combination.
        See xref:/midpoint/reference/tasks/activities/resource-object-set-specification/[] for more details.
    .. Click btn:[Next: Schedule].
. *Schedule* screen:
    * Keep the defaults and click btn:[Save & Run].

If you opt in for simulation, you'll see also the *Execution* screen in the wizard. Leave it to defaults, run the task, and inspect the simulation results as you do with other simulation tasks.

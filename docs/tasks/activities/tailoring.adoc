= Tailoring

Here we describe how to tailor predefined composite xref:../[activities].

In predefined composite activity, definitions of individual sub-activities can be _tailored_ in two ways:

1. Definitions of _existing_ sub-activities can be changed in some respects, e.g. changing their
execution mode, control flow, distribution, or reporting definition. Currently, it is not possible
to change the basic work specification for them.

2. In the future it will be possible to insert new sub-activities before, after, or in-between existing ones.

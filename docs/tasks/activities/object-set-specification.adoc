|===
| Item | Meaning | Default
| `type` | Type of objects to be processed. | Depends on the specific activity. Usually `ObjectType`.
| `query` | Query to use. | Depends on the specific activity. Usually none, i.e. all objects of given type are processed.
| `searchOptions` | Search options to use. | No options.
| `useRepositoryDirectly` | Whether to go directly to repository (bypassing e.g. authorizations). | Depends on the specific activity.
| `failedObjectsSelector` | Used for activities intended to re-process objects that failed to be processed by a "regular" activity
that was run before. | No failed objects selection. (Processing all objects.)

= Work Definition (Types of Activities)

This section defines _what_ the activity should do (i.e. the action) and on what _items_ (the item set).
As of midPoint 4.4, the following items are supported (MT means "Supports multi-threading", MN means "Support multi-node operation"):

.4+| Simple
.4+| Y
.4+| Y
| `tasks`
| xref:../object-set-specification/[Tasks] that should be considered for auto-scaling.
(Any task must be multi-node, running, and the auto-scaling for it must not be disabled.)

| Minimal interval between reconciliations, i.e. it will not reconcile workers if this time has not elapsed since the last one.

| `delay`
| Duration of each step in milliseconds.
| 0
| `steps`
| Number of steps.
| 1
| `stepInterruptibility`
| Should a step of this activity be interruptible? Value of `none` means that
the activity is not interruptible, except at step boundaries. If `hard` is used,
the activity can be interrupted only in "hard" way, i.e. by sending the Java interrupt signal.
Finally, `full` means that the activity can be interrupted any time.

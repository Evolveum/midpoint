= Distribution

Here we describe the definition of distribution for xref:../[activities].

[NOTE]
====
Not all of these options are supported for all activities!
Worker threads are supported only by activities marked as multi-thread-capable.
Buckets, worker tasks, and auto-scaling are supported only by activities marked as multi-node-capable.
The list of activities with these attributes is xref:../work/[here].
====

The following configuration options are available:

[%header]
[%autowidth]
|===
| Item | Meaning | Default

| `buckets`
| Division of the item set into separately processable units, so-called _buckets_.
This is to allow their processing by multiple tasks concurrently. (These are called _worker tasks_.)
Supported by activities marked as multi-node-capable.
| All items in a single bucket.

| `workers`
| Definition of how worker tasks should be created.
Supported by activities marked as multi-node-capable.
| All items are processed by a single task.

| `workerThreads`
| After obtaining items to be processed, each (worker) task can distribute them to multiple
worker threads for processing. This property defines their number.
Supported by activities marked as multi-threading-capable.
| All items are processing by a single thread.

| `subtask`
a| If present, the activity is executed in a specially-created subtask, devoted to their
execution. This is not normally needed, except for these reasons:

. Visibility: +
there are task-specific counters (e.g. related to environmental performance or internal midPoint performance)
that can be useful to be viewed separately for a given activity.

. Concurrent execution: +
if multiple activities are needed to run concurrently, they should be placed into distinct tasks.
| No subtask for the activity.

| `subtasks`
| Applicable to composite activities only. If present, all the sub-activities will be executed
in separate subtasks.
| No subtasks for the sub-activities.

| `autoscaling`
| Whether should this activity work distribution be auto-scaled.
| No auto-scaling.
|===

== Buckets

The work is divided into _buckets_ - abstract chunks of work.

Usually the work consists of iteration over a set of objects: either stored in midPoint repository (e.g. for recomputation task) or stored on a resource (e.g. import, reconciliation or live synchronization).
So, the most natural way of segmentation of the work into buckets is by defining a bucket as a set of objects for which a particular item - let us call it_ discriminator_ - has a value in a given interval.
The interval can be numeric, alphanumeric, or of anything comparable (e.g. timestamps).
In the future, OIDs can be used for segmentation as well.

There are other possibilities as well.
For example, one could segment users according to employee type, organization membership, and so on.
Work buckets can be defined using arbitrary search filter(s) over the set of objects.

=== Basic bucket state

A major distinction for a work bucket is: _is it complete or not_? The work bucket is declared `complete` if there's no work that can be done on it.
It does not mean that all the objects were successfully processed, though.
Some of them might incur failures; however, this is considered a normal situation and such objects are treated as processed.
(Re-processing of such objects can be implemented in the future, if needed.) The other state is `ready` meaning that there is some part of the bucket (maybe all of it) that needs to be processed.

Buckets are kept in the task `workState` data structure.
This allows us to track the progress done (at coarse-grained level), restarting the work on last known point if necessary.

=== Multi-node work distribution

Buckets allow us not only to track the progress, but to easily distribute the work among multiple worker tasks, with the intention of their distribution among cluster nodes.

For such multi-node scenario there is a _coordinator_ task and _worker_ tasks.
Coordinator holds the authoritative list of buckets to be processed.
Each worker tries to grab one or more buckets to work on.
Such buckets are then copied from the coordinator's `workState` into the worker's one.
To know they were allocated their state in coordinator's state is marked as `delegated`. (This is the third possible state besides `ready` and `complete`). After the bucket is processed, it is removed from worker's `workState` and marked in coordinator's `workState` as `complete`.

=== Bucket segmentation definition

The segmentation is defined like this:

.An example of segmentation configuration
[source,xml]
----
<task ...>
    ...
                <distribution>
                    <buckets>
                        <numericSegmentation>
                            <discriminator>attributes/number</discriminator>
                            <numberOfBuckets>100</numberOfBuckets>
                            <to>100000</to>
                        </numericSegmentation>
                    </buckets>
                </distribution>
</task>
----

This is to be read such that the discriminator (`attributes/number` attribute) is expected to have a numeric value from 0 to 99999 (inclusive) and we want do divide this range into 100 buckets.
So the first one will contain values from 0 to 999, second one from 1000 to 1999, then 2000-2999, etc.
And the last one (100th) will contain values from 99000 to 99999, inclusive.

=== Definition options

Current implementation supports the following segmentation definitions:

[%autowidth]
|===
| Segmentation definition | Parameters | Description

.3+| _all definitions_
| discriminator
| Item whose values will be used to segment objects into buckets (if applicable).
Usually required.

1+| matchingRule
1+| Matching rule to be applied when creating filters (if applicable).
Optional.

1+| numberOfBuckets
1+| Number of buckets to be created (if applicable).
Optional.

.3+| numericSegmentation
| from
| Start of the processing space (inclusive).
If omitted, 0 is assumed.

1+| to
1+| End of the processing space (exclusive).
If not present, both `bucketSize` and `numberOfBuckets` must be defined and the end of processing space is determined as their product.
In the future we might implement dynamic determination of this value e.g. by counting objects to be processed.

1+| bucketSize
1+| Size of one bucket.
If not present it is computed as the total processing space divided by number of buckets (i.e. `to` and `numberOfBuckets` must be present).

.3+| stringSegmentation
| boundaryCharacters
a| Characters that make up the prefix or interval.
Currently, the string segmentation is done by creating all possible boundaries (by combining `boundaryCharacters`) and then using these boundaries either as interval boundaries (if `comparisonMethod` is `interval`) or as prefixes (if `comparisonMethod` is `prefix`).

This is a multivalued property:

* the first value contains characters that occupy the first place in the boundary.
* the second value contains characters destined for the second place, etc.

An example:

* if `boundaryCharacters` = ("qx", "0123456789", "0123456789", "0123456789") then the following boundaries are generated: q000, q001, q002, ..., q999, x000, x001, ..., x999.
* this might be suitable e.g. for accounts that start either with "q" or with "x" and then continue with numbers, like q732812.

Another example:

* if `boundaryCharacters` = ("abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz", "0123456789abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz") then the following boundaries are generated: a0, a1, a2, ..., a9, aa, ab, ..., az, b0, b1, ..., b9, ba, ..., bz, ..., z0, z1, ..., z9, za, ..., zz.
* this might be suitable e.g. for alphanumeric account names that always start with alphabetic character.

*Beware*: current implementation requires that the characters are specified in the order that complies with the matching rule used.

Otherwise, empty intervals might be generated, like when using "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ" there will be an interval of e.g. "values greater than `z` but lower than `A` " (empty one) or "values greater than `Z` " (covers items covered by earlier intervals of a-b, b-c, ...).

1+| depth
1+| If a value `N` greater than 1 is specified here, `boundaryCharacters` values are repeated `N` times.
This means that if values of V~1~, V~2~, ..., V~k~ are specified, the resulting sequence is V~1~, V~2~, ..., V~k~, V~1~, V~2~, ..., V~k~ etc, with `N` repetitions - so `N` Ã— `k` values in total.

| comparisonMethod
| Either `interval` (the default), resulting in interval queries like `item >= 'a' and item < 'b'`. Or `prefix`, resulting in prefix queries like item `starts with 'a'`. Beware, when using `prefix` method, all the discriminator values are covered by `boundaryCharacters` you specify.
Otherwise some items will not be processed at all.

| oidSegmentation
2+| The same as stringSegmentation but providing defaults of `discriminator` = `#` and `boundaryCharacters` = `0-9a-f` (repeated `depth` times, if needed).

| explicitSegmentation
| content
| Explicit content of work buckets to be used.
This is useful e.g. when dealing with filter-based buckets.
But any other bucket content (e.g. numeric intervals, string intervals, string prefixes) might be used here as well.

| implicitSegmentation
2+| Implicit content of work buckets for given kind of activity to be used.

| segmentation
2+| How to partition the work into buckets and manage them.

3+h| Additional configuration for the Buckets

.3+| allocation
1+| bucketCreationBatch
1+| How many buckets are to be created at once

1+| workAllocationInitialDelay
1+| Size of random interval for the initial delay.

1+| workAllocationFreeBucketWaitInterval
1+| if specified, overrides the time used to wait for free bucket(s) reclamation.
This is applied when no free buckets are available but the work is not completely done.

.2+| sampling +
1+| regular +
1+a| Sampling using regular distribution of samples.
Following parameters are available:

* *interval* +
Interval of buckets in the sample (i.e. N means that each N-th bucket is selected).
* *sampleSize* +
Number of buckets in the sample.
It is converted to an interval by dividing the total number of buckets (if known) by the sample size.


1+| random +
1+a| Sampling using random distribution of samples.
Following parameters are available:

* *probability* +
Probability of including a bucket in the sample (a number between 0 and 1).

* *sampleSize* +
Approximate number of buckets in the sample.
It is converted to a probability by dividing the sample size by the total number of buckets (if known).

== Auto-scaling

Currently the auto-scaling configuration is very simple:

[%header]
[%autowidth]
|===
| Item | Meaning | Default
| `enabled`
| Is autoscaling enabled for this activity?
| `true` if the autoscaling configuration exists, `false` otherwise. (Note that this may change in the future.)

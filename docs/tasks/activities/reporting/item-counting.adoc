= Item Counting
:page-experimental: true

This section describes how should the activity deal with item counting, i.e. determining "expected progress"
for a bucket or overall. This value is necessary to determine the relative progress, especially if buckets are not used.

Usually there's no need to change the default values.

[%header]
[%autowidth]
|===
| Item | Meaning | Default

| `determineBucketSize`
| Should the activity execution try to determine the size of individual buckets (usually by counting
objects before processing)? When execution mode is `bucketAnalysis`, the bucket size is determined
regardless of this setting.
| Usually `whenInRepositoryAndNotBucketed`. Sometimes `never`. Depends on the activity type.

| `determineOverallSize`
| Should the activity execution try to determine expected total progress (usually by counting
objects before processing)? Currently not supported for worker tasks.
| Usually `whenInRepository`. Sometimes `never`, sometimes `always`. Depends on the activity type.

| `cacheOverallSize`
| Should we cache expected total progress between activity executions? (Meaning when suspending
and resuming an activity.)
| `false`

Values for `determineBucketSize`:

[%header]
[%autowidth]
|===
| Value | Meaning
| `always` | The activity will always execute the items counting.
| `whenNotBucketed` | The activity counts the items only if it is not bucketed (i.e. does not support bucketing
at all, or has a single "default" bucket only). The idea is that in this case the items count
really matters in order to estimate the relative task progress.
| `whenInRepository` | The activity counts the items only if the item source resides in repository
(the idea is that repository searches are faster than resource object searches).
| `whenInRepositoryAndNotBucketed` | The activity counts the items only if the item source resides in repository
and the activity is not bucketed.
| `never` | The activity does not count the items.
|===

Values for `determineOverallSize`:

[%header]
[%autowidth]
|===
| Value | Meaning
| `always` | The activity will always execute the items counting.
| `whenInRepository` | The activity counts the items only if the item source resides in repository
(the idea is that repository searches are faster than resource object searches).
| `never` | The activity does not count the items.

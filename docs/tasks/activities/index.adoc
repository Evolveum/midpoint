== Introduction

Since the beginning of midPoint, a _task_ represented something that should be done, like importing
all accounts from a given resource. Such tasks could be created, executed, checked for the current
status and progress, and so on. Gradually, tasks grew rich in features: multi-thread and multi-node
processing, the ability to suspend and resume (continuing where the work has stopped), various kinds
of statistics, and error-reporting and handling options.

Somewhere around midPoint 4.2, we realized that a task is something that can have
a rich internal structure: it can consist of distinct "parts". For example, reconciliation
tasks typically consist of operation completion, resource objects reconciliation, and remaining
shadows reconciliation.

In midPoint 4.4 we finally have found a suitable conceptual model for the tasks and their work:
the activities.

== Activities

An _activity_ describes the real work that should be carried out. It can be either simple or composite.

_Simple activities_ consist of a single _action_, carried out on a set of input _items_ (zero, one,
or more ones). Typical examples are recomputation, import from resource, or iterative bulk action.

On the other hand, _composite activities_ consist of a set of other activities - again, either simple
or composite. Composite activities can be _predefined_ (like reconciliation or cleanup) or
_custom_. Note that composite activities do not have their own actions nor item sets. They are defined
solely by their constituent sub-activities.footnote:[This is not 100% true, as there may be
some auxiliary actions, like recording a starting timestamp for reconciliation, that are built into
the predefined composition logic. But those are really minor actions, not visible from the outside.
However, in the future we may be able to define custom composition logic for predefined or even for
custom composite activities.]

=== A Few Examples

==== Example 1: User recomputation - a simple activity with a set of input items

image::activity-user-recomputation.png[alt="User recomputation activity", width=400]

This activity runs a `recomputation` action over a set of all users.

==== Example 2: Non-iterative bulk action - a simple activity with no input items

image::activity-non-iterative-bulk-action.png[width=400,alt="Non-iterative bulk action"]

This activity runs a `nonIterativeScripting` action (i.e. non-iterative bulk action).
The bulk action does not expect any input items. It simply runs provided Groovy script (in this case).

==== Example 3: Reconciliation - a (predefined) composite activity

image::activity-reconciliation.png[width=900,alt="Reconciliation activity"]

The reconciliation activity consists of three sub-activities. They are partially dependent:
the third one (remaining shadows reconciliation) depends on the second one (resource objects reconciliation).

Each of the sub-activities has a different action, and a different item set.

==== Example 4: User recomputation + custom bulk action - a (custom) composite activity

image::activity-user-recomputation-with-custom-bulk-action.png[width=700,alt="User recomputation with bulk action"]

The custom activity consists of two sub-activities. Both of them are defined by the user:
a recomputation, followed by a custom bulk action.

== Configuring the Activities

=== Configuring Simple and Predefined Composite Activities

A definition of a simple (or predefined composite) activity contains the following sections:

[%header]
[%autowidth]
|===
| Section | Meaning
| xref:work.adoc[`work`] | The work that is to be done. Contains the definition of the activity and the item set.
| xref:execution-mode.adoc[`execution` and `executionMode`] | Defines the overall mode of execution: `full`, `preview`, `dryRun`, `none`,
`bucketAnalysis` and related parameters.
| xref:control-flow.adoc[`controlFlow`] | Items like prerequisites, preconditions, error handling strategy, and so on.
| xref:distribution.adoc[`distribution`] | Distribution of the work executed as part of this activity into threads, buckets, and worker tasks.
| xref:reporting/[`reporting`] | How various aspects of activity execution are reported, using logging, tracing,
profiling, reporting, and so on.
| xref:tailoring.adoc[`tailoring`] | Tailors the definition of individual sub-activities in a predefined composite activity.
|===

(More details are provided in the linked documents.)

=== Configuring Custom Composite Activities

In a current implementation, the custom composite activity definition contains just a single section:

[%header]
[%autowidth]
|===
| Section | Meaning
| `composition` | Defines the composite activity as a set of its constituent sub-activities.
|===

NOTE: Currently, we do not yet support inheriting the non-functional aspects (`executionMode`, `controlFlow`,
`distribution`, `reporting`) from the composite to the sub-activities. Neither we do not support specifying
common parts of the work definition for these. (Like object set specification, or some options.)
Therefore, the sub-activities have to be fully defined, independently of each other. We plan to improve
this in the future.

== Activities and Tasks

As described above, _activities_ represent the work that should be done, while _tasks_ are actual
vehicles that make sure that work is done.

Definition of an activity deals typically with:

* what action should be done, and on which objects,
* how should errors be treated,
* how should be the work distributed into threads and worker tasks,
* how should be the work reported on,
* and so on.

Definition of a task deals typically with:

* under what identity should the work be done,
* should the execution be one-time or recurring - and if the latter, at what time intervals,
* what should be done when the execution thread stops, e.g. by node going down,
* what are limitations regarding the node(s) on which the execution should take place,
* what are specific configurations of e.g. caching or operation result handling,
* and so on.

(The distinction is sometimes clearer and sometimes not.)

Generally, a single task can contain a single or multiple activities, running in the form of
an activity tree. And vice versa, a single activity can be distributed to multiple tasks,
when coordinator-workers setup (multi-node processing) is chosen.

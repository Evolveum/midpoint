= Resource Object Set Specification

Here we describe how sets of resource objects are specified in xref:../[activities].
(Represented by `ResourceObjectSetType` type.)

This configuration is used mainly for xref:/midpoint/reference/tasks/synchronization-tasks/[synchronization activities].
(The shadow cleanup activity uses it as well, although this may change in the future.)

[%header]
[%autowidth]
|===
| Item | Meaning | Default
| `resourceRef` | Resource against which we want to execute the activity. | No default (value must be specified).
| `kind` | Kind of objects to be processed. | See below.
| `intent` | Intent of objects of given kind to be processed. | See below.
| `objectclass` | Class of objects to be processed. | See below.
| `query` | Object query used to refine/replace the default query stemming from the above parameters. | None.
| `queryApplication` | How should be resource object set query applied to the basic query stemming from
`resourceRef` / `objectclass` / `kind` / `intent` specification. | Depends on activity. E.g. `replace` for import from resource.
| `searchOptions` | Search options to use. | No options.
| `failedObjectsSelector` | Used for activities intended to re-process objects that failed to be processed by a "regular" activity
that was run before. See xref:../object-set-specification/#_failed_objects_selector[here]. | No failed objects selection. (Processing all objects.)

== Object Set Determination

=== Import and Reconciliation

The set of resource objects that are to be synchronized using import and reconciliation activities is determined like this:

1. First, a _query_ is formulated, using the specified parameters.
2. Then, each object that is provided by the query, is _re-checked_ against the parameters, and skipped if it does not match.

This two-step process is needed because the query itself is executed on the resource, so it cannot check for kind and intent
for individual objects returned. Only object class is relevant for resource-based searches.

The query is determined from `kind`, `intent`, and `objectclass` like this:

. If `kind` is specified (with or without object class), then the object class is found by looking at `kind` and `intent` values.
We strongly recommend specifying the `intent`, especially for versions before midPoint 4.6.
For 4.6 and above, please see xref:/midpoint/reference/resources/resource-configuration/schema-handling/changes-in-4.6.adoc#_defaults_for_kind_and_intent[how the defaults are handled].
. If `kind` is not specified but `objectclass` and `intent` are, then the behavior is undefined.
Please do not do this.
. If only `objectclass` is specified (i.e. both `kind` and `intent` are not present), then it is used.
(There are some issues with this setting present before midPoint 4.6, see bug:MID-7470[].)
. If none of them is specified, then an error is thrown.
Import and reconciliation cannot proceed without specific object class.

Each object to be processed is then checked if all the `kind`, `intent`, and `objectclass` match.
(The algorithm ignores potential hierarchical relations between object classes, like that `inetOrgPerson` is a subclass of `person`.
Exact match is required.)

Therefore, to avoid any misinterpretations, we suggest using one of the following combinations when specifying import or reconciliation activity:

1. either both `kind` and `intent` (preferred),
2. or `objectclass`.

=== Live Synchronization

For live synchronization, the object class is what is important.
Currently, no kind/intent filtering is done, nor custom query is supported.

The object class is determined in a way similar to the import and reconciliation case:

1. If `kind` is specified (with or without object class), then the object class is found by looking at `kind` and `intent` values.
2. If only `objectclass` is specified (i.e. both `kind` and `intent` are not present), then it is used.
3. If only `objectclass` and `intent` are specified (i.e. `kind` is not present), then the `objectclass` is used.
4. If none of them is specified, all object classes are processed. (If the connector supports this mode of operation.)

=== Asynchronous Update (Experimental Functionality)

Only the `resourceRef` is used. All other parameters are currently ignored.

== Query Application Mode

[%header]
[%autowidth]
|===
| Value | Meaning
| `append` | Specified query is "appended" to the default query that results from
the resourceRef/kind/intent/objectclass tuple. This is the most reasonable option, to be used
in almost all cases.
| `replace` | Specified query replaces the default query that results from
the resourceRef/kind/intent/objectclass tuple.

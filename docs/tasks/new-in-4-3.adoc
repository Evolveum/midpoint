= Tasks: What's New In 4.3
:page-since: "4.3"
:page-keywords: task, error, statistics, progress, 4.3, midScale

Tasks are one of key areas of the xref:/midpoint/projects/midscale/[midScale project] aimed
at significant improvement of midPoint scalability. It is natural that they have got a number
of enhancements and new features in 4.3. Let us have a look at some of them.

[NOTE]
====
The midScale project continues into midPoint 4.4 release. The work on tasks will be put into
its final form in 4.4 as well. Therefore, what is presented here, is basically a report on a
work in progress.

Formally, many of these features are marked as experimental in 4.3. They should work,
but details will be most probably fine-tuned based on experiences and user feedback.

== Processing Errors

=== Error Reporting

When an object fails to be processed by a task, this fact should be reported in a reliable
and understandable way. In previous versions of midPoint this was generally true, except for
some border cases: for example when an object couldn't be correctly retrieved
from a resource.footnote:[Sometimes the tasks were even not able to recover from
such a situation and suspended immediately.]

Since 4.3, almost all kinds of failures are reliably reported by creating so-called operation
execution records. These records are then used to display erroneous objects. (The way how
these objects are shown by GUI has been improved in 4.3 as well.)

=== Error Handling

MidPoint can now automatically or semi-automatically retry failed objects processing.
This aspect is rather complex, so it is covered in a xref:../task-error-handling/[separate document].

== Progress and Statistics Reporting

=== Progress vs. Statistics

When a task runs, we need to see how much of the work has already been done, how much work
remains, and what is the approximate pace at which we are proceeding. This is necessary e.g.
to be able to estimate the time to completion.

Before 4.3, this information was somehow present, but was not complete nor precise enough.
Moreover, aspects like work buckets and task suspension and resumption made some of this
information unreliable.

Since 4.3, we rigorously distinguish two aspects:

1. _Progress_: what part of the overall work has been done?
2. _Iteration statistics_: how many items were processed?footnote:[The term is not final. It will probably change.]

These two aspects start to differ when a task is suspended and then resumed, because in such a case some
objects get processed twice. This duplicate processing is reflected in iteration statistics,
but intentionally excluded from progress information.

Technically, a new `structuredProgress` container was added to `TaskType` objects. The statistics
about processed items (`operationStats/iterativeTaskInformation`) were restructured.

=== Task Parts

New conceptual model of task execution was conceived. It is not formalized and documented yet,
but its basic features can be seen in the xref:/midpoint/projects/midscale/design/tasks/[preliminary design document].
The new entity identified there is the _task part_. A task part can be viewed as a distinct action (e.g. a recomputation)
executed on a set of objects covered by single midPoint query (e.g. all users).

Task part is a basic unit of execution and reporting. Therefore, both the progress and iteration
statistics are kept for each of the parts separately.

=== Throughput

The throughput (i.e. how many items have been processed per time unit) is a key performance indicator
of a task. Unfortunately, task suspension and resumption, as well as multi-node task scenarios
(having multiple tasks executing in parallel, even some of them starting later than others)
complicate the throughput computation.

In midPoint 4.3 we introduced more precise algorithm in this area. It is based on exact recording
of execution start and stop moments - see `operationStats/iterativeTaskInformation/part/execution`
structure.

=== Outcome

Before 4.3, we roughly distinguished two outcomes of an object processing within a task: success or failure.

Now we have three basic outcome types: success, failure, or "skip". The newly added skip outcome means
that the item was obtained (either from the repository or from a resource), but for any reason, its
further processing was abandoned.

Typical examples - among many - are:

* object retrieved multiple times due to a complex repository query,
* irrelevant live sync or async update change,
* a protected account.

In addition to this basic three-way classification, an outcome can be qualified by arbitrary URI.
Therefore, it is possible to analyze e.g. why objects were skipped, or to distinguish between
various types of failures. Although this feature is not fully enabled in 4.3, all relevant data
structures are already in place, so it is prepared for the future.

Selected statistics are then indexed by outcome. It is thus possible to see not only how
many successes, failures, or skips there was, but also e.g. how much time was spent processing
objects leading to particular outcome, what was the last object with that outcome, and so on.

=== Objects Being Processed

As a minor improvement, for tasks that concurrently process more objects we now show
not only single currently processed object, but all of them.

=== Synchronization Statistics

Synchronization statistics, i.e. how did synchronization states of shadows (like `linked`, `unlinked`,
`unmatched`, and so on) change, is now more precise and informational.

1. Now we distinguish not only "before" and "after" moments, but "on processing start", i.e. the
state of the shadow in repository, "on synchronization start", i.e. the state of the shadow
as determined by the synchronization algorithm at the beginning, and "on synchronization end",
i.e. the state after the synchronization process ends.

2. Instead of showing only aggregate counters for "before" and "after" moments, we now show the counts for
each particular state transition, e.g. "unlinked to linked" (simply speaking). This provides more plastic image
of what really happened during the task execution.

3. Objects excluded from synchronization - e.g. protected objects - are no longer counted
under (artificial) synchronization states, but under standard "skip" outcome, categorized by
the reason of exclusion. This further increases the clarity of the information.

=== Provisioning Statistics

The time spent in provisioning operations is now collected not only globally (i.e. per object class
on resource) but also per each operation kind. These statistics are now also summarized through
the task trees.

== Task Tree State Reporting

Task trees - i.e. tasks that have subtasks corresponding to individual parts and/or workers,
were added to midPoint in version 3.8, but not adequately covered by GUI until now. One particular
pain point was how the state of a task tree was displayed. Technically, root task is in a waiting
state, but displaying it in such a way is grossly misleading for the users.

Since 4.3 we distinguish between "technical" and "user-visible" state of the task. The former
is called `schedulingState` and has four values: `ready`, `waiting`, `suspended`, and `closed`.
(It corresponds roughly to pre-4.3 execution status.) The latter is user-visible and has six values:
`running`, `runnable`, `waiting`, `suspended`, and `closed`. It uses the same `executionStatus`
property as in 4.2 and before. For example, when a task tree executes, its root task has scheduling
state of `waiting` but its user-visible execution state is `running`.

This area is not fully covered in 4.3. For example, similar clarification is needed also for
the operation result. Some other features, like notifications, are also still not task-tree aware.

== Presentation

The GUI was improved significantly. For example, statistical information is now shown using
nice colored graphs and widgets, instead of "dry" textual form as was before.

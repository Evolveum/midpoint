= Shadow Reclassification Task
:page-toc: top
:page-upkeep-status: green

== Introduction

After a xref:/midpoint/reference/resources/shadow/[shadow object] is discovered on a resource, midPoint tries to assign a kind and an intent to it, or _classify_ it.
Kind and intent define the type of the object from midPoint's point of view.
(For more information, see xref:/midpoint/reference/resources/shadow/kind-intent-objectclass/[]).
Only after being classified, midPoint can reasonably work with the shadow: create or find a focus object for it, execute inbound and outbound mappings, and so on.

MidPoint uses xref:/midpoint/reference/resources/resource-configuration/schema-handling/#_delineation[object type delineation] in order to classify the shadows.

However, there may be situations - often occurring during solution development or testing - when you need to change the delineation of object types either because you've found out that it is not quite correct, or, what is more often, you need to split existing object types to finer-grained ones.
All new (unclassified) objects will get classified using the new delineation automatically.
But, primarily to ensure solution stability, midPoint does *not* reclassify shadows that are already classified.

== Shadow Reclassification Activity

Fortunately, there is an option there: the `shadowReclassification` activity.
This activity takes specified shadows and forces their reclassification.
It can be run within a task like this:

== Considerations

Reclassification of shadows is safe if both these conditions are met:

. There are no focus objects referencing these shadows.
. There are no associations between these shadows.

But what it the above is not true?
Be prepared that the behavior of objects can *radically change* after reclassification:

. Both inbound and outbound mappings can be totally different.
. Synchronization to focus objects (users, roles, orgs, and so on), including the archetypes, can be totally different.
This includes correlation algorithms.
. Participation of shadows in associations can change, as associations are defined over object types.
. Participation of shadows in simulated references (and, hence, the associations again) can change, as simulated references can be defined over object types as well.
. Because xref:/midpoint/reference/concepts/metadata/[provenance metadata] (which are used to provide default xref:/midpoint/reference/expressions/mappings/range/[provenance-based mapping ranges] for multi-value items) are bound to object type and association type, after changing any of these, the respective xref:/midpoint/reference/expressions/mappings/#_mapping_maintenance_tasks[mapping maintenance tasks] must be done.

Note that reclassification can be xref:/midpoint/reference/simulation/[simulated], so that you can see which objects will be reclassified and to what values.
(You will not see the other consequences listed above, though.)

== Automatic reclassification

As said above, midPoint never reclassifies shadows on its own.

There is only a single exception to this rule:
It the current type of a shadow (defined by kind and intent) no longer exists in the resource definition.
This is the situation in which midPoint considers it to be quite safe to do the reclassification.

Such a situation can occur typically when you change the intent of the existing object type.
In this case, reclassification will be automatically executed when reading shadows of that type from the resource.
*If* the classification rules provide the new intent to all of original members of the object type, many of the problems mentioned above will not occur - *except* for the provenance metadata related ones.
Hence, it is strongly advisable to avoid renaming intents carelessly.

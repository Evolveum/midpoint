== Introduction

Midpoint 4.3 Faraday introduced experimental support for new Axiom Query language,
which is less verbose than XML Queries.


== Setup & Quick Demo

The demo will be performed on Hogwarts Midpoint sample.

=== Enabling Axiom Query Language

In order to enable Query Language in GUI, you must enable Admin GUI experimental
features.

1. In Admin GUI navigate to `Configuration -> System -> Admin GUI`
2. Click `Show Empty fields` in `Admin GUI Configuration` section
3. Select `True` in `Enable experimental features`
4. Save configuration changes, logout and login in order to changes to be applied.


=== Using Axiom Query in GUI

By default Axiom Query is not default search filter type. You can switch to Axiom Query
 by clicking down arrow `â–¼` in search button and select `Axiom Query`.

Lets start with simple examples:

1. Go to Users -> All Users
2. Change to `Axiom Query`
3. Search for all Weasleys using `familyName = 'Weasley'` or `name endsWith "weasley"`



== Concepts

* Axiom Query is simplified syntax for standard Midpoint filters (XML)
* It does not introduce new types of filters, just nicer names
* It is based on existing filters, so it shares same limitations

== Filters

=== Filter specification

Most Filters are in form of **item** **operator** **value**

item::
  Item Path - specifies on which item filter matching should be applied
operator::
  Name of filter to be used
value::
  Value literal or Item Path which should be matched according filter specification.
  String needs to be enclosed in quotes (`'`) or double-qoutes (`"`)

=== Comparison Filters


* Comparison filters have common short form aliases for convenience

[cols=[,a,a]]
|===
| Filter Name | Alias | Example
| equal | `=` | `familyName = "Weasley"`
| not equal | `!=` | `familyName != "Weasley"`
| less | `<` | `activation/validTo < "2022-01-01"`
| lessOrEqual | `<=` |
| greater | `>` |
| greaterOrEqual | `>=` |
|===



* Equals
    * `familyName = "Weasley"`
    * `familyName equal "Weasley"`
    * `familyName endsWith[polyStringNorm] "weasley"`


=== Text Filters

startsWith::
  Searching for organization units starting with `quiddich`: `name startsWith "quiddich"`
contains::
  Matches string property if it contains specified substring.

  `name contains "mc"` - All names which contains "mc"
endsWith::
  `name endswith 'weasley'`
fullText::
  `. fullText "Minerva"`

=== Logical Filters

* `givenName = "Fred" and familyName = "Weasley"`
* `givenName = "George" or givenName = "Fred"`
* `givenName = "Anthony" and familyName not startsWith "G"`


=== Nested Filters


=== Reference Filters

inOrg::

. inOrg "00000000-team-0org-0000-111111111111"


assignment/targetRef/@/name = "quiddich-griffindor"




assignment/targetRef/@ matches (name startsWith "quiddich" and name endsWith "griffindor")


==== Nested Filters

`assignment/targetRef matches (relation = manager)`

==== Advanced Examples & Use

=== 'Joins' / referenced values search

Midpoint supports filtering also on properties of referenced objects
(for repository based searchs) and it is possible to use this feature from Axiom Query.


.Search for all Weasleys, who are in Griffindor Quiddich Team
----
familyName = "Weasley" and assignment/targetRef/@/name = "quiddich-griffindor"
----

=== Use in XML / Other object definitions

This is a XML-based query language that was used in midPoint for years.
It is gradually replaced by xref:midpoint-query-language/[midPoint Query Language].

We strongly recommend to use midPoint Query Language for querying data.

== Examples

.Searching for account by DN
[source,xml]
----
<q:equal>
    <q:path>c:attributes/icfs:name</q:path>
    <q:value>cn=foobar,uo=people,dc=nlight,dc=eu</q:value>
</q:equal>

----


.Searching for user by user name or full name (short polyString version)
[source,xml]
----
<q:or>
    <q:equal>
        <q:path>c:name</q:path>
        <q:value>jack</q:value>

    <q:equal>
        <q:path>c:fullName</q:path>

    </q:equal>
</q:or>

----


.Searching for user by user name or full name (long polyString version)
[source,xml]

        <q:orgRef>
            <q:oid>ef2bc900-76e0-59e2-86d6-004f02d30000</q:oid>

The search filter language definition is part of Query Schema. See the `FilterType` and derived types in the XSD file for more details.


== Filters with Expressions

.Equals filter with expression
[source,xml]
----
<q:equal>
    <q:path>name</q:path>
    <c:expression>
       <c:path>$c:account/c:attributes/ri:uid</c:path>
    </c:expression>
</q:equal>

----


.Reference with inner expression
[source,xml]
----
<q:org>
    <q:ref>
        <q:oid>
            <c:expression>
                <c:path>$role:orgRef</c:path>
            </c:expression>
        </q:oid>
    </q:ref>
    <q:maxDepth>unbounded</q:maxDepth>
</q:org>

----


.Reference with inner search filter (NOT YET IMPLEMENTED)
[source,xml]
----
<q:org>
    <q:ref>
        <q:query>
        	<q:filter>
        		<q:equals>
    	    		<q:path>name</q:path>
    	    		<c:expression>
    	    			<c:path>$role/extension/orgName</c:path>
    	    		</c:expression>

== Motivation

Long time ago, midPoint was completely based on XML.
Therefore a XML-based query language was a natural choice.
There was even a SOAP web service interface, therefore the XML-based query language was working fine in WSDL interface definitions, can be checked by XSD schema and so on.

However, as midPoint evolved to be independent of particular data representation format (XML, JSON, YAML), the XML-based query language did not make much sense any more.
It was also not entirely user-friendly.
Therefore it was replaced by xref:midpoint-query-language/[midPoint Query Language]

While searching with midPoint Query Language you can encounter various error messages.
Some of them can be quite cryptic, especially for new users.

== Error messages in GUI

Error messages in GUI are displayed below the query.


=== Path is not present in type

image::err-path-is-not-present.png[Error path is not present]

In this case administrator wanted to search for user with name "adam".

Midpoint says that attribute namex can't be found in the object type UserType that is displayed in the view Users we are searching.

This is the most typical error you can encounter.
It is caused by incorrect identification of property (attribute) in query.
Often this error is caused by typo in the name of the attribute.
In the example above it is additional "x" in _name_.

The {http://midpoint.evolveum.com/xml/ns/public/common/common-3} is the namespace of the type UserType. You can ignore it at this place.

| Request
| Find user with name "adam"

| Query
| namex = "adam"

| Error message
| Path *namex* is not present in type {http://midpoint.evolveum.com/xml/ns/public/common/common-3} *UserType*

| Reason
| In this case the reason for error was typo: _namex_ vs _name_

| Correct query

[cols="15h,50" width=85%]
|====
| Request
| Find all users with assigned role "System user".

| Query
| assignment/targetRef = "System user"

| Error message
| Definition PRD:{.../common/common-3} *targetRef* {.../common/common-3}ObjectReferenceType[0,1],RAM is not property

| Reason
a| The targetRef is a reference to an object. Not to a searchable property. +
To search for the assigned object name you need to reference properties within the object. E.g. its name.

| Correct query
| assignment/targetRef/@/name = "System user"

| Troubleshooting hints
a| * Verify, that the attribute is present in the object type you are searching. You can check it at xref:../searchable-items.adoc[searchable items] page.
* Use dereferencing operator "@" for referencing attributes of the assigned object.

[cols="15h,50" width=85%]
|====
| Request
| Find all users with normal lockout status.

| Query
| activation/lockoutStatus = "Normal"

| Error message
| Cannot find enum value for string *'Normal'* in class com.evolveum.midpoint.xml.ns._public.common.common_3.*LockoutStatusType*

| Reason
a| The schema defines enumerated value for this attribute. In this case the allowed values are "normal" and "locked". All lowercase.

| Correct query
a| activation/lockoutStatus = "normal"

| Troubleshooting hints
a| * Search for allowed values in schema definition. Schemas are described in
xref:../../../../schema/schemadoc.adoc[SchemaDoc].
Selet version according your midPoint version. +
In this case search in schema "common/common-3" for "LockoutStatusType"

// Alternatively, you can search midPoint schema files #on github# for verification.
// TODO - for this case - linka na github na schema file.

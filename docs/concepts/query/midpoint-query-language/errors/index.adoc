While searching with midPoint Query Language you can encounter various error messages.
Some of them can be quite cryptic, especially for new users.

== Error messages in GUI

Error messages in GUI are displayed below the query.


=== Path is not present in type

image::err-path-is-not-present.png[Error path is not present]

In this case administrator wanted to search for user with name "adam".

Midpoint says that attribute namex can't be found in the object type UserType that is displayed in the view Users we are searching.

This is the most typical error you can encounter.
It is caused by incorrect identification of property (attribute) in query.
Often this error is caused by typo in the name of the attribute.
In the example above it is additional "x" in _name_.

The {http://midpoint.evolveum.com/xml/ns/public/common/common-3} is the namespace of the type UserType. You can ignore it at this place.

[cols="15h,50" width=85%]
|====
| Request
| Find user with name "adam"

| Query
| `namex = "adam"`

| Error message
| Path *namex* is not present in type {http://midpoint.evolveum.com/xml/ns/public/common/common-3} *UserType*

| Reason
| In this case the reason for error was typo: _namex_ vs _name_

| Correct query
| `name = "adam"`

| Troubleshooting hints
a| * Verify, that the attribute is present in the object type you are searching. You can check it at xref:../searchable-items.adoc[searchable items] page.
* Attribute _name_ differs from name that is displayed in GUI (the _displayName_). Search is using name of the attribute. The translation between _name_ and _displayName_ (english) is described at xref:../searchable-items.adoc[searchable items] page.
* Verify, that you don't have typo (e.g. case mismatch) in the name of the property
* Verify, that the view is displaying the object type you want to search. You can see its name at the end of the error message.

=== Path is not present in type - dereferencing

image::err-path-is-not-present-deref.png[Error path is not present - dereferencing]

Another kind of the "path is not present in type" error can occur while searching in referenced objects.


[cols="15h,50" width=85%]
|====
| Request
| Find all users with assigned role identified by value "III" of identifier attribute.

| Query
| `assignment/targetRef/@ matches (identifier="III")`

| Error message
| Path identifier is not present in type {http://midpoint.evolveum.com/xml/ns/public/common/common-3}AssignmentHolderType

| Reason
a| While using dereferencing, midPoint has to know type of the referenced object to correctly process the query. +
In this query, midPoint can't identify the type of the referenced object and incorrectly assumes it is of AssignmentHolderType.

| Correct query
| `assignment/targetRef/@ matches (. type RoleType and identifier="III")`

| Troubleshooting hints
a| * In this case you need to redefine the type of the referenced object. The code `. type RoleType` tells midPoint that type of the referenced object is RoleType. MidPoint then can find `identifier` attribute correctly.
* When the type is explicitly defined, midPoint knows the actual schema of the object. It means, that you can search extension attributes as well. +
E.g. the `assignment/targetRef/@ matches (. type RoleType and extension/sapType="SAP555")` is valid query when the sapType extension attribute was defined in extension schema.

=== Definition is not property

image:err-definition-is-not-property.png[Error definition is not property]

[cols="15h,50" width=85%]
|====
| Request
| Find all users with assigned role "System user".

| Query
| `assignment/targetRef = "System user"`

| Error message
| Definition PRD:{.../common/common-3} *targetRef* {.../common/common-3}ObjectReferenceType[0,1],RAM is not property

| Reason
a| The targetRef is a reference to an object. Not to a searchable property. +
To search for the assigned object name you need to reference properties within the object. E.g. its name.

| Correct query
| `assignment/targetRef/@/name = "System user"`

| Troubleshooting hints
a| * Verify, that the attribute is present in the object type you are searching. You can check it at xref:../searchable-items.adoc[searchable items] page.
* Use dereferencing operator "@" for referencing attributes of the assigned object.

=== Additional unsupported filter specified

image:err-add-unsupported-filter.png[Error additional unsupported filter specified]

[cols="15h,50" width=85%]
|====
| Request
| Query all assignments of a role.

| Query
| `assignment/targetRef matches (name="ABC:Admin")`

| Error message
| Additional unsupported filter specified: name="ABC:Admin"

| Reason
a| Query should be searching in referenced objects but the dereferencing operator `@` is missing.

| Correct query
a| `assignment/targetRef/@ matches (name="ABC:Admin")`

| Troubleshooting hints
a|
|====


==== Additional unsupported filter specified: type=...

image:err-add-unsupported-filter-type.png[Error - additional unsuported filter specified - type]

[cols="15h,50" width=85%]
|====
| Request
| Query all users who have any role assigned.

| Query
| `assignment/targetRef matches (type=RoleType)`

| Error message
| Additional unsupported filter specified: type=RoleType

| Reason
a| matches filter in query requires _"targetType"_ keyword to search for assigned object type.

| Correct query
a| `assignment/targetRef matches (targetType=RoleType)`

| Troubleshooting hints
a| See xref:../introduction.adoc#_querying_values_of_different_types[querying values of different types].
|====


=== Cannot find enum value for string

image:err-cannot-find-enum-value.png[Error cannot find enum value for string]

[cols="15h,50" width=85%]
|====
| Request
| Find all users with normal lockout status.

| Query
| `activation/lockoutStatus = "Normal"`

| Error message
| Cannot find enum value for string *'Normal'* in class com.evolveum.midpoint.xml.ns._public.common.common_3.*LockoutStatusType*

| Reason
a| The schema defines enumerated value for this attribute. In this case the allowed values are "normal" and "locked". All lowercase.

| Correct query
| `activation/lockoutStatus = "normal"`

| Troubleshooting hints
a| Search for allowed values in schema definition. Schemas are described in
xref:/midpoint/reference/schema/schemadoc.adoc[SchemaDoc].
Select version according your midPoint version. +
In this case search in schema "common/common-3" for "LockoutStatusType"

=== Couldn't count objects

This is error message telling that processing of the query failed somehow during processing.

To know why it failed you need to open the error message and see what happened in the messages below.

==== Unsupported matching rule 'stringIgnoreCase'

image:err-unsupported-matching-rule.png[Error unsupported matching rule]

[cols="15h,50" width=85%]
|====
| Request
| Find all users with locality "Edinburgh" ignoring case. Find all with "edinburgh", "EDINBURGH" or "Edinbugh".

| Query
| `locality =[stringIgnoreCase] "Edinburgh"`

| Error message
| Unsupported matching rule 'stringIgnoreCase' for value type 'PolyStringType'.

| Reason
a| The matching rules relate to attribute type. +
locality is of PolystringType and `stringIgnoreCase` matching rule is defined for strings only. +
For polystring you need to use `origIgnoreCase` matching rule.

| Correct query
| `locality =[origIgnoreCase] "Edinburgh"`

| Troubleshooting hints
a| * For more information about matching rules in query see xref:../introduction.adoc#_matching_rules[matching rules chapter] in introduction to Midpoint Query Language.
* List of all matching rules is defined in xref:/midpoint/reference/concepts/matching-rules.adoc[matching rules] page.

==== Cannot invoke ..SubfilterOrValueContext.valueSet() because "subfilterOrValue" is null

image:err-cannot-invoke-subfilter-value-is-null.png[Error cannot invoke subfilter - value is null]

[cols="15h,50" width=85%]
|====
| Request
| Find all users having name similar to "ang" using levenshtein distance search.

| Query
| `name levenshtein("ang",2,true)`

| Error message
| Cannot invoke "com.evolveum.axiom.lang.antlr.query.AxiomQueryParser$SubfilterOrValueContext.valueSet()" because "subfilterOrValue" is null

| Reason
a| The `levenshtein` is filter name. Not a function with parameters. +
There is missing space between `levenshtein` filter name and `(`

| Correct query
| `name levenshtein ("ang",2,true)`

| Troubleshooting hints
a| xref:../introduction.adoc#_similarity_filters[Similarity search filters] require 3 attributes. The set of attributes is enclosed in brackets.

==== QName value expected

image:err-qname-value-expected.png[Error - QName value expected]

[cols="15h,50" width=85%]
|====
| Request
| Find all owners (find all users who have any assignment assigned as owner.)

| Query
| `assignment/targetRef matches ( relation="org:owner")`

| Error message
| QName value expected

| Reason
| Relation is of QName type. QName values are included in queries without quotation marks. +

| Correct query
| `assignment/targetRef matches (relation=org:owner)`  or +
`assignment/targetRef matches (relation=owner)`

| Troubleshooting hints
| See xref:../introduction.adoc#_querying_values_of_different_types[querying values of different types]. +
Additionally, namespaces are optional.

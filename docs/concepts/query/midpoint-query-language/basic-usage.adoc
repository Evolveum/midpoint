This document provides information and examples of queries in midPoint Query Language, mainly used in objects while configuration of midPoint itself.

Additional examples how to use the midPoint query in GUI can be found in xref:/midpoint/guides/gui-midpoint-query-examples[Advanced search - EXAMPLES].

== Searching by Archetype Name

Search for reports with archetype specified by its name

.midPoint Query
----
archetypeRef/@/name = "Report export task"
----

.XML Query
[source, xml]
----
<filter>
  <eq>
    <path>archetypeRef/@/name</path>
    <value>Report export Task</value>
  </eq>
<filter>
----

Where:

* `archetypeRef/@` - specifies we are not matching reference value, but it's target. In this case it is archetype.



== Search by Assigned Role Name

.midPoint Query
----
assignment/targetRef/@/name = "Role Name"
----

Where:

* `assignment/targetRef/@` -specifies that we are not matching reference value, but it's target. In this case it is assigned role.


== Users with account on specific resource

Search for users, which have account specified resource, with default intent.

.midPoint Query
----
linkRef/@ matches (
  . type ShadowType
  and resourceRef matches (oid = "ff735c0a-21e3-11e8-a91a-df0065248d2d")
  and intent = "default"
)
----

Where:

* `linkRef/@`  - we dereference target of `linkRef`, this behaves similar to SQL `JOIN`,
    allows us to filter on properties of the target
* `matches` specifies subfilter for dereferenced target, filter which linkRef must match
** `. type ShadowType`, we are searching for shadows on resource, this is necessary in order to be able to use shadow properties for filter
** `resourceRef matches (oid = "..." )` - matches specific resource, to which shadow belongs
** `intent = "default"` - matches shadow with default intent


.XML equivalent
[source, xml]
----
<query>
<filter>
   <exists>
      <path>linkRef/@</path>
      <filter>
         <and>
            <ref>
               <path>resourceRef</path>
               <value oid="ff735c0a-21e3-11e8-a91a-df0065248d2d" />
            </ref>
            <equal>
               <path>intent</path>
               <value>default</value>
            </equal>
         </and>
      </filter>
   </exists>
</filter>
</query>

.Translated SQL query in native PostgreSQL repository
[source, sql]
----
select u.oid, u.fullObject from m_user u
where exists (
   select 1 from m_ref_projection refpj
   where u.oid = refpj.ownerOid and exists (
      select 1 from m_shadow sh
      where refpj.targetOid = sh.oid and (sh.resourceRefTargetOid = ? and sh.resourceRefRelationId = ? and sh.intent = ?)
   )
)
limit ?
----


=== All roles which are assigned to System users

NOTE: Filter is currently supported in midPoint 4.6 Postgres native repository only

// All roles which are assigned to system users
.midPoint Query using `UserType` as referencedBy
----
. referencedBy (
  @type = UserType
  and @path = assignment/targetRef
  and archetypeRef/@/name = "System user"
)
----

.midPoint Query using `AssignmentType` for referencedBy
----
. referencedBy (
   @type = AssignmentType
   and @path = targetRef
   and . ownedBy (
      @type = UserType
      and @path = assignment
      and archetypeRef/@/name = "System user"
   )
)
----

=== All roles, which are assigned using inducement
NOTE: Filter is currently supported in midPoint 4.6 Postgres native repository only

// All roles which are assigned using inducement
.midPoint Query
----
. referencedBy (
  @type = AbstractRoleType
  and @path = inducement/targetRef
)
----

.XML Query
[source, xml]
----
<filter>
  <referencedBy>
    <type>AbstractRoleType</type>
    <path>inducement/targetRef</path>
  </referencedBy>
</filter>
----

=== All roles, which are assigned to administrator using full text serach

.midPoint Query
----
. referencedBy (
   @type = UserType
   and @path = roleMembershipRef
   and . fullText "administrator"
)
----

.XML Query
[source, xml]
----
<filter>
  <referencedBy>
    <type>UserType</type>
    <path>roleMembershipRef</path>
    <filter>
      <fullText>
        <value>administrator</value>
      </fullText>
    </filter>
  </referencedBy>
</filter>
----

=== Search on assigned role using fullText

.midPoint Query
----
assignment/targetRef/@ matches (
   . fullText "secret"
)
----

.XML Query
[source, xml]
----
<filter>
  <exists>
    <path>assignment/targetRef/@</path>
    <fullText>
      <value>secret</value>
    </fullText>
  </exists>
</filter>

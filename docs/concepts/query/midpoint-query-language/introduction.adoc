This document provides introduction to the *midPoint Query Language*.
Some details are omitted, and there are some simplifications for clarity.

After completing this document, reader should be able to apply midPoint Query Language in configuration.
We encourage to test the queries using the xref:./query-playground/index.adoc#_query_playground[query playground], which provides convenient and interactive environment for experimenting with queries.

== Language Description

The midPoint Query Language is designed to allow specification of a complex queries.
Yet the basic structure of the language is relative simple and easy to understand.

The _query_ is a combination of a _filter_ with additional parts such as paging and sorting.
It is the _filter_ part that attracts most attention.

Simple filter usually take the usual form of `item filterName value` triple, where:

item::
Item Path - specifies the xref:./searchable-items.adoc[searchable item] on which should be the filter applied. +
filterName::
Name of filter to be used.
value::
Value literal or Item Path which should be matched according filter specification.
String needs to be enclosed in quotes (`'`) or double-qoutes (`"`)

Some examples of valid filters are:

* `fullName = "John Doe"`
* `givenName startsWith "J"`
* `activation/effectiveStatus = "enabled"`

=== Item Path

The item on which data are filtered is specified by xref:/midpoint/reference/concepts/item-path/[item path].
In its simplest form it is a name of object _property_, or names of items and containers separated by slashes. Such as:

* `fullName`
* `activation/administrativeStatus`
* `attributes/uid`

=== Filter Name
Item path is followed by filter name or its alias, which specifies which filtering condition should be used.

==== Comparison filters

Following tables summarizes common property filters:

[options="header", cols="15,10,30", width=70]
|====
| Name | Alias | Description
| `equal` | `=` | Matches if any item is equal to value
a| `not equal` +
`notEqual`
| != | Matches if item is different from value

| `less` | `<` | Matches if item is smaller than value
| `lessOrEqual` | `&lt;=` | Matches if item is smaller or equal to the value
| `greater` | `>` | Matches if item is greater than value
| `greaterOrEqual` | `>=` | Matches if item is greater or equal to value
|====

.Examples of comparison filters on users
`familyName = "Doe"`::
equals filter - All users with familyName Doe
`familyName = ("Doe", "Smith")`::
equals multi value filter - All users with familyName Doe or Smith
`name != "Administrator"`::
not equals filter - Everyone except administrator
`name != ("Administrator", "Leonardo")`::
not equals multi value filter - Everyone except Administrator and Leonardo
`activation/validTo < "2022-01-01"`::
less filter - All users which will not be valid after 2021

Equal (`=`) and notEqual (`!=`) filters allows also set of values enclosed within brackets to be on the right side of the query.
The query `name = ("adam","john")` provides the same results as `name = "adam" or name = "john"` . +
Only values are allowed within the set.

Comparison filters also supports item path on right side of filter.
For example `activation/validFrom > activation/validTo` should return all objects with incorrectly set activations (activation start is after activation end).

[#_matching_rules]
==== Matching rules
Comparison filter can be even more specified by definition of matching rule in the filter.
The syntax of matching rule in query is: `filter[matchingRuleName]`

.Example of matching rules usage
`givenName =[origIgnoreCase] "Adam"`::
query matches all 'Adam', 'adam' or 'ADAM' in givenName
`emailAddress endsWith[stringIgnoreCase] "@test.com"`::
query matches user with email address ending with specific domain.

See different matching rules in the examples above.
There are different matching rules defined for PolyStringType (givenName) and strings (emailAddress).
List of all matching rules is defined in xref:../../matching-rules.adoc[matching rules] page.

==== String filters

Following table summarizes additional filters that can be applied on string and polystring values.

[options="header", cols="15,40", width=70]
|====
| Name | Description

| `startsWith` | Matches if item starts with specified string.
| `contains` | Matches string property if it contains specified substring.
| `endsWith` | Matches string property if it ends with specified substring.
| `fullText` | Performs full text search. Item path must be dot (.)
|====

=== Value

Value is usually a string literal, enclosed in double quotes.
However, value may take various forms.
For example, it may be a path of another item, e.g. in case when the query compares two items.
The value may be also quite complex.

The exact form of the value part of the filter depends on the operator and type of the value.

[#_querying_values_of_different_types]
==== Querying values of different types

The exact syntax of queries for values of different types is described in the following table:

[options="header", cols="10,30, 60", width=80]
|====
| Type | Query | Note

| boolean
| `extension/coreMember = true`
| Boolean values do not need quotes. Allowed values are `true` and `false`.

| string
| `emailAddress endsWith "testorg.com"`
| String values are enclosed in quotes (') or double quotes (").

| PolystringType
| `givenName = 'Adam'`
| Values of PolystringType are enclosed in quotes (') or double quotes (").

| int
| `extension/height > 170`
| Number values do not need quotes. Only common property filters (=,>, ..) are defined for number types.

| float
| `extension/perfScore > 1.05`
| Number values do not need quotes. Only common property filters (=,>, ..) are defined for number types.

| dateTime
| `metadata/createTimestamp >= "2024-03-01"`
| DateTime values are enclosed in quotes (') or double quotes ("). It can be compared as dates or date and time - written in format of https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601[ISO-8601].

|
| `metadata/createTimestamp >= "2024-03-01T15:30:00"`
| While comparing time values. DateTime values entered without timezone are considered to be in the same timezone as running midPoint.

|
| `extension/empStartDate >= "2019-10-01" and extension/empStartDate < "2019-10-02"`
| As datetime values contain exact time value up to milliseconds you need to compare dates as intervals. See examples.

| ObjectReferenceType
| `assignment/targetRef/@/name = "End user"`
| Object references are queried using `matches` filter or dereferencing operator `@`. See <<Advanced filters>> chapter below.

| QName
| `assignment/targetRef matches (relation=owner)`
| QName values (relation in this example) are entered into query without quotation marks. Do not use them.

|
| `assignment/targetRef matches (relation=org:owner)`
| QNames may use namespaces. The namespaces are not necessary in the query - of course, if the values don't collide. So, both queries with `relation=owner` or `relation=org:owner` returns the same results.
|====


=== Logical Filters

Logical filters are used to combine several sub-filters into one filter or to
negate filter.

[source,midpoint-query]
----
givenName = "John" and familyName = "Doe"
----

There is a usual set of logic operators:

.Logical Operators
[options="header", cols="10,30,30", width=70]
|====
| Operator | Example | Description

| `and`
| `givenName = "John" and familyName = "Doe"`
| All subfilters must be true.

| `or`
| `givenName = "Bill" or nickName = "Bill"`
| Any of the subfilters is true.

| `not`
| `givenName not startsWith "J"` +
`givenName != "John"`
| Logical negation. Not prefixes filter name (as seen in example).

|====

You can use round brackets to group logical statements into more readable form.

----
familyName = "Doe" and (givenName = "John" or givenName ="Bill")
----

=== Object selection

Midpoint performs queries over defined set of objects.
In GUI, the set is defined by actually opened view.

In configuration, the object type must be *explicitly specified* for the query.
Not within the query itself.
See the configuration snippet below. The query will select `User` with name "XYZ".

[source,XML]
----
    <activity>
        <work>
            <recomputation>
                <objects>
                    <type>UserType</type>
                    <query>
                        <q:filter>
                            <q:text>name = "XYZ"</q:text>
                        </q:filter>
                    </query>
                </objects>
            </recomputation>
        </work>
    </activity>
----


== Advanced filters

=== matches filter

`matches` filter operates on the container or structured value and specifies conditions that must be met by a single container value.
It is in form of `itemPath matches (subfilter)`, where subfilter (and item paths) are relative to the container, for example `assignment/validTo < "2022-01-01"` is same as `assignment matches (validTo < "2022-01-01")`.

The `subfilter` is any supported filter, where paths are relative to container
and allows us to specify multiple conditions (joined using <<Logical Filters>>), which must be met by container value.

Example of matches filter:
----
activation matches (
  validFrom > "2022-01-01"
   and validTo <"2023-01-01"
)
----


[IMPORTANT]
====
For filters matching multiple properties of multi value containers (such as `assignment`).
It is important to consider if we want to match a container where one container value meets all criteria, or these criteria could be met by multiple different container values.

If these multiple criteria must be met by one container value you must use `matches`.

The filter `assignment/validFrom > "2022-01-01" and assignment/validTo <"2023-01-01"` is different from `assignment matches (validFrom > "2022-01-01" and validTo <"2023-01-01")`.
First will match user who has one assignment starting after 2022 and possible other assignment ending by 2023.
The second filter with match user who has an assignment which starts in 2022 and expires before 2023.
====

=== inOid filter

midPoint query allows querying objects by its oid using `inOid` filter.
The inOid queries is triplet consisting of object representation, `inOid` filter and list of oid values enclosed in brackets.
The midPoint object is represented by `.` (dot character).

Example of querying one specific object by its OID:

`. inOid ("00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000702")`

Example of querying 2 specific objects by their OID:

`. inOid ("eb21455d-17cc-4390-a736-f1d6afa82057", "87e048ae-6fcf-47bb-a55e-60acb8604ead")`


=== Reference Filters

Reference filters allows to match on references themselves using
`matches` filter on properties of referenced objects using dereferencing operator (`@`).

You can also perform inverse queries using `referencedBy` filter to search
for object by properties of it's referencer (e.g. search roles by properties of its members).

[#_matches_filter_in_references]
==== matches filter in references

Reference itself is structured value, which contains target oid, target type and relationship type.

You can use `matches` filter with nested subfilters to target these properties of object reference:

oid::
Exact match of target oid (UUID as string). Example: `assignment/targetRef matches (oid = efaf89f4-77e9-460b-abc2-0fbfd60d9167)`
relation::
Matches any reference with specified relation (QName). Example: `roleMembershipRef matches (relation = manager)`
targetType::
Matches any reference with specified target type (QName). Example: `roleMembershipRef matches (targetType = OrgType)`

It is possible to match on any combination of these three properties of reference,
but only `equals` and `and` filter are supported.

----
roleMembershipRef matches (
  oid = "bc3f7659-e8d8-4f56-a647-2a352eead720"
  and relation = manager
  and targetType = OrgType
)
----

NOTE: If you need to query referenced objects of specified *type* you must use *targetType* keyword. You can see it in example above.

==== Dereferencing

Dereferencing allows to write filter condition which is executed on referenced object.
Dereferencing is done using `@` special character in item path after reference, item path `assignment/targetRef/@` points to object referenced by targetRef instead of targetRef itself.
This allows you to continue path with properties of referenced objects such as
`assignment/targetRef/@/name` - which means `name` of assigned object.

For example, this enables us to search for users with assigned role by role name instead of oid. (but it is executed a bit slower, since we need to dereference objects).
`assignment/targetRef/@/name = "Superuser"` - matches any user who is directly assigned role of superuser.

NOTE: To match also users, who are indirectly assigned role, you should use `roleMembershipRef` instead of `assignment/targetRef`.

IMPORTANT: If you need to match referenced object on multiple properties you should use `matches` filter.

NOTE: Dereferencing is not supported for object references defined via schema extensions.

==== Dereferencing inside reference matches filter

NOTE: This feature is currently supported in midPoint native repository only

If user wants to match on properties of reference itself and also on properties of it's target
it is possible now, using dereferencing inside `reference matches` filter.

In order to match on target you can use dereferencing and matching: `@ matches (...)`.

.Find all users, which are managers for roles with `Business Role` archetype
----
assignment/targetRef matches ( <1>
  targetType = RoleType <2>
  and relation = manager <3>
  and @ matches ( <4>
     archetypeRef/@/name = "Business Role" <5>
  )
)
----
<1> We are matching references in `assignment/targetRef`
<2> Type of referenced target should be `RoleType`
<3> Users relation to assigned role is `manager`
<4> We dereference target and match on its properties
<5> Name of role archetype should be `Business Role`. This is done by dereferencing `archetypeRef` using `@` in item path.


==== referencedBy filter

`referencedBy` filter allows you to find object based on properties on objects, which
reference it. Since object as whole is referenced the item path

In order to use `referencedBy` filter you must also specify `type` of objects, which references it,
and `path` of object reference, which is used for reference (e.g. `assignment/targetRef` or `inducement/targetRef`)

The short query syntax is:

.Find all roles which are assigned to Administrator
----
. referencedBy ( <1>
  @type = UserType <2>
  and @path = assignment/targetRef <3>
  and name = "Administrator" <4>
)
----
<1> `. referencedBy` filter name
<2> `@type` - required, special filter property which specified `type` of objects which should be considered in evaluation of filter. In this case we are interested in users.
<3> `@path` - required, special filter property which specifies which Object reference should be used in filter, in this case we are interested in directly assigned roles (`assignment/targetRef`)
<4> Filter which referencing object must match, in this case the name of referencing object must be `Administrator`.


NOTE: `referencedBy` filter is not supported for object references defined via schema extensions.

==== ownedBy Filter

NOTE: Filter is currently supported in midPoint native repository only

ownedBy filter allows for matching indexed containers based on properties of their parent (owning object or container).

The syntax is similar to referencedBy. ownedBy filter can only be applied on self path (`.`). The properties of ownedBy filter are:

type:: (Required) Type of parent / owner.

path:: (Optional) Name / location of container inside parent.

filter:: (Optional) Filter, to which parent needs to conform, filter is explicit element in XML/YAML/JSON. In midPoint query any filter which is not special property of ownedBy is automatically nested in filter.

.Using searchContainers, find all inducements
----
. ownedBy ( @type = AbstractRoleType and @path = inducement)
----

=== Organization Filters

Organization filters are used to filter objects based on their organization membership.
These filters operate on object as a whole, so item path must be `.` (the dot).

[options="header", cols="10,10,30", width=70]
|===
| Name | Value | Description

| inOrg | OID (UUID) | Matches if object is part of organization unit or its subunits.
| isRoot| N/A | Matches if object is organization root. Filter does not have value.
|===


`. inOrg "f9444d2d-b625-4d5c-befd-36c9b5861ac4"`::
All object which are members of specified organization and all its subunits (whole SUBTREE)

`. inOrg[ONE_LEVEL] "f9444d2d-b625-4d5c-befd-36c9b5861ac4"`::
If you need to match only users in specified organization, use ONE_LEVEL matching rule.

`. isRoot`::
All roles and organization units which are organization tree roots.

=== Other filters

[options="header",cols="10,10,30",width=70]
|===
| Name | Value | Description
| exists | N/A | Matches if item exists (has any value). Filter does not have value.
| type | object type | Matches if object is of specified type. Usually used in combination with `and` filter for dereferenced objects, or it is needed to match on property defined in more specific type.
|===

[#_similarity_filters]
=== Similarity filters

NOTE: Filters are currently supported in midPoint native repository only

To perform fuzzy (not exact) matching, midPoint query language provides 2 filters: `levenshtein` and `similarity`.

Aside from other filters, right side of the query consists of triplet of parameters enclosed in brackets.
Their meaning is explained in following table:

[options="header",cols="10,10,30,30",width=90]
|===
| Name | Value | Description | Parameters
| levenshtein
| (value, threshold, inclusive)
| Matches objects where queried attribute has levenshtein distance *lower than* (or equal - depends on inclusive parameter value) the threshold specified.
a| * value (string) - string value that is compared with queried attribute.
* threshold (integer) - the compared distance value. The result must be less than (or equal) the threshold.
* inclusive (boolean) - whether objects with threshold value would be included in result (true) or not (false).

| similarity
| (value, threshold, inclusive)
| Matches objects where queried attribute has similarity *greater than* (or equal - depends on inclusive parameter value) the threshold specified. +
Similarity of 1 mean exact match, 0 no similarity.
a| * value (string) - string value that is compared with queried attribute.
* threshold (float) - the compared distance value. The result must be greater than (or equal) the threshold.
* inclusive (boolean) - whether objects with threshold value would be included in result (true) or not (false).
|===

As the filters are implemented using https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/fuzzystrmatch.html#FUZZYSTRMATCH-LEVENSHTEIN[levenshtein PostgreSQL function] and https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/pgtrgm.html[similarity PostgreSQL function], they work with native repository only.

`name levenshtein ("ang",2,true)`::
All users whose name attribute has levenshtein distance 2 or lower from string "ang".

`name levenshtein ("ang",2,false)`::
All users whose name has levenshtein distance lower than 2 from string "ang".

`name similarity ('gren', 0.5, true)`::
All users whose name has similarity of 0.5 and lower to 'gren'.


NOTE: The Levenshtein distance between two strings is the number of modifications required to transform one string (s1) into the other string (s2). It allows for single-character edits such as deletion, insertion, and substitution. For example, for s1=“helloIndia” and s2=“halloindia,” the Levenshtein distance is 2.

=== Filtering all objects of specified type

Sometimes, in configuration files, you need to select all objects of specific object type.
Object collection selecting all users in midPoint is an example of such case.

To select all objects just omit `<filter>` element in the query or whole query.

The object collection below lists all roles (all objects of RoleType) in midPoint.

[source,XML]
----
<objectCollection oid="72b1f98e-f587-4b9f-b92b-72e251dbb255">
    <name>All roles</name>
    <type>RoleType</type>
</objectCollection>

[#_query_examples]
== Basic Query Examples

This chapter provides information and examples of queries in midPoint Query Language, mainly used in objects while configuration of midPoint itself.

Additional examples can be found in xref:/midpoint/reference/concepts/query/midpoint-query-language/query-examples[query examples] page.

=== Search by Archetype Name

Search for reports with archetype specified by its name

.midPoint Query
----
archetypeRef/@/name = "Report export task"
----

Where :

* `archetypeRef/@` - specifies that we are not matching reference value, but it's target. In this case it is archetype.


=== Search by Assigned Role Name

.midPoint Query
----
assignment/targetRef/@/name = "Role Name"
----

Where:

* `assignment/targetRef/@` -specifies that we are not matching reference value, but it's target. In this case it is assigned role.


=== Users with account on specific resource

Search for users, which have account specified resource, with default intent.

.midPoint Query
----
linkRef/@ matches (
  . type ShadowType
  and resourceRef matches (oid = "ff735c0a-21e3-11e8-a91a-df0065248d2d")
  and intent = "default"
)
----

Where:

* `linkRef/@`  - we dereference target of `linkRef`, this behaves similar to SQL `JOIN`,
allows us to filter on properties of the target
* `matches` specifies subfilter for dereferenced target, filter which linkRef must match
** `. type ShadowType`, we are searching for shadows on resource, this is necessary in order to be able to use shadow properties for filter
** `resourceRef matches (oid = "..." )` - matches specific resource, to which shadow belongs
** `intent = "default"` - matches shadow with default intent


==== All roles which are assigned to System users

.midPoint Query using `UserType` as referencedBy
----
. referencedBy (
  @type = UserType
  and @path = assignment/targetRef
  and archetypeRef/@/name = "System user"
)
----

.midPoint Query using `AssignmentType` for referencedBy
----
. referencedBy (
   @type = AssignmentType
   and @path = targetRef
   and . ownedBy (
      @type = UserType
      and @path = assignment
      and archetypeRef/@/name = "System user"
   )
)
----

==== All roles, which are assigned using inducement
NOTE: Filter is currently supported in midPoint native repository only

.midPoint Query
----
. referencedBy (
  @type = AbstractRoleType
  and @path = inducement/targetRef
)
----


==== All roles, which are assigned to administrator using full text search

.midPoint Query
----
. referencedBy (
   @type = UserType
   and @path = roleMembershipRef
   and . fullText "administrator"
)
----


==== Search on assigned role using fullText

.midPoint Query
----
assignment/targetRef/@ matches (
   . fullText "secret"
)
----

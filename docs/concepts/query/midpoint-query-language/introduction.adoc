This introduces the structure of the midPoint Query Language (MQL) and describes available filters.

== Language Description

MQL is designed to allow constructing complex queries.
Yet the basic structure of the language is relatively simple and easy to understand.

A _query_ is a combination of a _filter_ and additional parts, such as paging and sorting.

Simple filters usually take form of `item filterName value` triplets consisting of:

* <<item_path,*Item path*>>: Specifies the xref:./searchable-items.adoc[searchable item] to which the filter is applied.
* <<filter_name,*Filter name*>>: Defines the name of the filter.
* <<value,*Value*>>: Defines a value literal or item path that should be matched according to the filter specification.
Note that strings need to be enclosed in quotes (`'`) or double-quotes (`"`).

Some examples of valid filters are:

* `fullName = "John Doe"`
* `givenName startsWith "J"`
* `activation/effectiveStatus = "enabled"`

[[item_path]]
=== Item Path

xref:/midpoint/reference/concepts/item-path/[Item path] specifies the item by which data are filtered.
In its simplest form, it is a name of an object _property_, or names of items and containers separated by slashes, such as:

* `fullName`
* `activation/administrativeStatus`
* `attributes/uid`

[[filter_name]]
=== Filter Name
The filter name, or its alias, specifies a filtering condition that should be used.

[[value]]
=== Value

Values are usually string literals, enclosed in double quotes.
However, they can take various forms.
For example, a value may be a path to another item, e.g. when the query compares two items.

In some cases, values may be complex.
The exact form of the value part of the filter depends on the operator and the type of the value.

[#_querying_values_of_different_types]
==== Querying values of different types

The exact syntax of queries for values of different types is described in the following table:

[options="header", cols="10,30, 60", width=80]
|====
| Type | Query | Note

| boolean
| `extension/coreMember = true`
| Boolean values do not require quotes. Valid values are `true` and `false`.

| string
| `emailAddress endsWith "testorg.com"`
| String values are enclosed in quotes (') or double quotes (").

| PolystringType
| `givenName = 'Adam'`
| Values of the Polystring type are enclosed in quotes (') or double quotes (").

| int
| `extension/height > 170`
| Number values do not require quotes. Only common property filters (=,>, ..) are defined for number types.

| float
| `extension/perfScore > 1.05`
| Number values do not require quotes. Only common property filters (=,>, ..) are defined for number types.

| dateTime
| `metadata/createTimestamp >= "2024-03-01"`
| DateTime values are enclosed in quotes (') or double quotes ("). They can be compared as dates, or as date and time - following the of https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601[ISO-8601] format.

|
| `metadata/createTimestamp >= "2024-03-01T15:30:00"`
| While comparing time values, datetime values entered without a timezone are considered to be in the same timezone as the running midPoint.

|
| `extension/empStartDate >= "2019-10-01" and extension/empStartDate < "2019-10-02"`
| As datetime values contain the exact time value (down to milliseconds), you need to compare dates as intervals.

| ObjectReferenceType
| `assignment/targetRef/@/name = "End user"`
| Object references are queried using the `matches` filter, or the dereferencing operator `@`. See <<advanced_filters,Advanced filters>>.

| QName
| `assignment/targetRef matches (relation=owner)`
| QName values (a relation in this example) are entered into queries without quotation marks.

|
| `assignment/targetRef matches (relation=org:owner)`
| QNames may use namespaces. Unless values conflict, namespaces are not necessary in queries. In this case, both `relation=owner` and `relation=org:owner` return the same results.
|====

[[simple_filters]]
== Simple Filters

* <<comparison_filters,*Comparison filters*>>
* <<string_filters,*String filters*>>
* <<logical_filters,*Logical filters*>>


[[comparison_filters]]
=== Comparison Filters

The following table summarizes common property filters:

[options="header", cols="15,10,30", width=70]
|====
| Name | Alias | Description
| `equal` | `=` | Matches items equal to a value.
a| `not equal` +
`notEqual`
| != | Matches items different from a value.

| `less` | `<` | Matches items smaller than a value.
| `lessOrEqual` | `&lt;=` | Matches items smaller or equal to a value.
| `greater` | `>` | Matches items greater than a value.
| `greaterOrEqual` | `>=` | Matches items greater or equal to a value.
|====

.Examples of using comparison filters on users:
`familyName = "Doe"`::
Equals filter, searches for all users with familyName "Doe".
`familyName = ("Doe", "Smith")`::
Equals multi value filter, searches for all users with familyName "Doe" or "Smith".
`name != "Administrator"`::
Not equals filter, searches for everyone except for "Administrator".
`name != ("Administrator", "Leonardo")`::
Not equals multi value filter, searches for everyone except for "Administrator" and "Leonardo".
`activation/validTo < "2022-01-01"`::
Less filter, searches for all users that will not be valid after 2021.

In Equal (`=`) and notEqual (`!=`) filters, you can enclose values within brackets on the right side of the query.
The query `name = ("adam","john")` provides the same results as `name = "adam" or name = "john"` . +
In these filters, only values are allowed within the set.

Comparison filters also support item path on the right side of filters.
For example `activation/validFrom > activation/validTo` should return all objects with incorrectly set activations, i.e. objects for which the activation starts after it ends.

[#_matching_rules]
==== Matching Rules
Comparison filters can be further enhanced with matching rules.
The syntax of a matching rule in a query is: `filter[matchingRuleName]`

.Example usage
`givenName =[origIgnoreCase] "Adam"`::
Query matches all cases of "Adam" in givenName with various casings, such as 'Adam', 'adam', or 'ADAM'.
`emailAddress endsWith[stringIgnoreCase] "@test.com"`::
Query matches users with email addresses that end with the "test.com" domain.

For a list of all matching rules, refer to the xref:../../matching-rules.adoc[] page.

[[string_filters]]
=== String Filters

The following table summarizes additional filters that can be applied to string and polystring values.

[options="header", cols="15,40", width=70]
|====
| Name | Description

| `startsWith` | Matches items starting with a specified string.
| `contains` | Matches string properties that contain a specified substring.
| `endsWith` | Matches string properties that end in a specified substring.
| `fullText` | Performs a full text search. The item path must be a dot (.)
|====


[[logical_filters]]
=== Logical Filters

Logical filters are used to combine several subfilters into one filter or to negate a filter, for example:

[source,midpoint-query]
----
givenName = "John" and familyName = "Doe"
----

You can use the following logic operators:

.Logical Operators
[options="header", cols="10,30,30", width=70]
|====
| Operator | Example | Description

| `and`
| `givenName = "John" and familyName = "Doe"`
| All subfilters must be `true``.

| `or`
| `givenName = "Bill" or nickName = "Bill"`
| Any of the subfilters has to be `true``.

| `not`
| `givenName not startsWith "J"` +
`givenName != "John"`
| Logical negation where `not` prefixes the filter name.

|====

You can use brackets to group logical statements for better readability, for example:

----
familyName = "Doe" and (givenName = "John" or givenName ="Bill")
----

=== Object Selection

Midpoint performs queries over a defined set of objects.
In GUI, this set is defined by the currently opened view.

In configuration, the object type must be explicitly specified for a query.
However, not within the query itself.
See the configuration snippet below in which the query selects `User` with name "XYZ".

[source,XML]
----
    <activity>
        <work>
            <recomputation>
                <objects>
                    <type>UserType</type>
                    <query>
                        <q:filter>
                            <q:text>name = "XYZ"</q:text>
                        </q:filter>
                    </query>
                </objects>
            </recomputation>
        </work>
    </activity>
----


== Advanced Filters

=== Matches Filter

The _Matches_ filter operates on a container or a structured value and specifies conditions that must be met by a single container value.
It is in the form of `itemPath matches (subfilter)`, where `subfilter` (and item paths) are relative to the container, for example `assignment/validTo < "2022-01-01"` is the same as `assignment matches (validTo < "2022-01-01")`.

The `subfilter` is any of the supported filters in which paths are relative to the container.
It enables you to specify multiple conditions (joined using <<Logical Filters>>) that must be met by container values.

Example of the matches filter:
----
activation matches (
  validFrom > "2022-01-01"
   and validTo <"2023-01-01"
)
----


[IMPORTANT]
====
For filters that match multiple properties of multi value containers (such as `assignment`), it is important to consider if you want to match a container where one container value meets all criteria, or if these criteria could be met by multiple different container values.

If these multiple criteria must be met by one container value, you must use the `matches` filter.

The filter `assignment/validFrom > "2022-01-01" and assignment/validTo <"2023-01-01"` is different from `assignment matches (validFrom > "2022-01-01" and validTo <"2023-01-01")`.
The first filter will match users who have one assignment starting after 2022 and, potentially, another assignment ending by 2023.
The second filter with match users who have an assignment which starts in 2022 and expires before 2023.
====

=== inOid Filter

MQL enables you to query objects by their object identifiers (OID) using _inOid_ filters.
An inOid query is a triplet consisting of an object representation, an `inOid` filter, and a list of oid values enclosed in brackets.
The midPoint object is represented by the dot (`.`) character.

Example of querying one specific object by its OID:

`. inOid ("00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000702")`

Example of querying 2 specific objects by their OIDs:

`. inOid ("eb21455d-17cc-4390-a736-f1d6afa82057", "87e048ae-6fcf-47bb-a55e-60acb8604ead")`


=== Reference Filters

Reference filters match references utilizing _matches_ filters on properties of referenced objects, using the dereferencing operator (`@`).

You can also perform inverse queries using a `referencedBy` filter to search for an object by properties of its referencer.
For example, search for roles by properties of their members.

[#_Matches_Filter_in_References]
==== Matches Filter in References

A reference is a structured value which contains the target OID, type, and relationship.

You can use _matches_ filters with nested subfilters to target these properties of an object reference:

* *oid*: Matches the target OID exactly (UUID as a string). Example: `assignment/targetRef matches (oid = efaf89f4-77e9-460b-abc2-0fbfd60d9167)`
* *relation*: Matches any reference with a specified relation (QName). Example: `roleMembershipRef matches (relation = manager)`
* *targetType*: Matches any reference with a specified target type (QName). Example: `roleMembershipRef matches (targetType = OrgType)`

It is possible to match any combination of these three properties of a reference but only `equals` and `and` filters are supported.

----
roleMembershipRef matches (
  oid = "bc3f7659-e8d8-4f56-a647-2a352eead720"
  and relation = manager
  and targetType = OrgType
)
----

NOTE: If you need to query referenced objects of a specified type you must use _targetType_ keyword. See the example above.

==== Dereferencing

With dereferencing, you can write filter conditions which are executed on referenced objects.
Dereferencing is done using the `@` special character in the item path after the reference.
For example, the `assignment/targetRef/@` item path points to an object referenced by `targetRef`` instead of `targetRef`` itself.
This enables you to enhance paths with properties of referenced objects, such as
`assignment/targetRef/@/name` which means `name` of the assigned object.

For example, dereferencing enables us to search for users with a specific assigned role by the role name instead of its OID, even if the execution time will be slightly longer since we need to dereference objects.
`assignment/targetRef/@/name = "Superuser"` - matches any user who is directly assigned role of superuser.

WARNING: Dereferencing is not supported in authorizations, in-memory, and in resource searches.

NOTE: To also match users who are assigned a role indirectly, you should use `roleMembershipRef` instead of `assignment/targetRef`.

IMPORTANT: If you need to match a referenced object on multiple properties, you should use the _matches_ filter.

NOTE: Dereferencing is not supported for object references defined via schema extensions.

==== Dereferencing Inside Reference Matches Filter

This feature is currently supported only in the midPoint native repository.
It is not supported in authorizations, in-memory and in resource searches.

You can use dereferencing inside a _reference matches_ filter to match properties of a reference, and also properties of its target.

In order to match a target, you can use dereferencing and matching: `@ matches (...)`.

.Find all users who are managers for roles with the `Business Role` archetype
----
assignment/targetRef matches ( <1>
  targetType = RoleType <2>
  and relation = manager <3>
  and @ matches ( <4>
     archetypeRef/@/name = "Business Role" <5>
  )
)
----
<1> We are matching references in `assignment/targetRef`.
<2> The type of the referenced target should be `RoleType`.
<3> The relation of users to the assigned role is `manager`.
<4> We dereference the target and match its properties.
<5> Name of the role archetype should be `Business Role`.
This is done by dereferencing `archetypeRef`, using `@` in the item path.


==== referencedBy Filter

With _referencedBy_ filters, you can find objects based on properties of objects that reference them since the object as whole is referenced in the item path.

In order to use a `referencedBy` filter, you must also specify the `type` of objects which references them,
and the `path` of the object reference which is used for the reference (e.g. `assignment/targetRef` or `inducement/targetRef`).

.This looks for all roles assigned to Administrator:
----
. referencedBy ( <1>
  @type = UserType <2>
  and @path = assignment/targetRef <3>
  and name = "Administrator" <4>
)
----
<1> `. referencedBy` is the filter name.
<2> `@type` (required) is a special filter property which specifies the `type` of objects that should be considered when evaluating the filter. In this case, we are interested in users.
<3> `@path` (required) is a special filter property which specifies which object reference should be used in the filter.
In this case, we are interested in directly assigned roles (`assignment/targetRef`).
<4> Filter which the referencing object must match.
In this case, the name of the referencing object must be `Administrator`.


NOTE: _referencedBy_ filters are not supported for object references defined via schema extensions.

==== ownedBy Filter

_ownedBy_ filters are currently only supported in the midPoint native repository.
They are not supported in authorizations, in-memory, and in resource searches.

With these ownedBy filters, you can match indexed containers based on properties of their parent, i.e. the owning object or container.

The syntax of this filter is similar to that of the referencedBy filter.
You can only apply ownedBy filters to the current object path (`.`).
The properties of ownedBy filter are:

* *type*: (Required) Defines the type of the parent/owner.
* *path*: Defines the name/location of the container inside the parent.
* *filter*: Specifies a filter to which the parent needs to conform.
The filter is an explicit element in XML/YAML/JSON.
In midPoint queries, any filter that is not a special property of ownedBy is automatically treated as a nested filter.

.The following example looks for all inducements:
----
. ownedBy ( @type = AbstractRoleType and @path = inducement)
----

=== Organization Filters

Organization filters are used to filter objects based on their organization membership.
These filters operate on an object as a whole and so the item path must be `.` (the dot).

[options="header", cols="10,10,30", width=70]
|===
| Name | Value | Description

| inOrg | OID (UUID) | Matches an object if it is a part of an organization unit or its subunits.
| isRoot| N/A | Matches an object if it is the organization root. This filter does not have any values.
|===


`. inOrg "f9444d2d-b625-4d5c-befd-36c9b5861ac4"`::
Matches all object that are members of the specified organization and all its subunits (whole SUBTREE).

`. inOrg[ONE_LEVEL] "f9444d2d-b625-4d5c-befd-36c9b5861ac4"`::
If you only need to match users in a specified organization, use the ONE_LEVEL matching rule.

`. isRoot`::
Matches all roles and organization units that are organization tree roots.


[#_similarity_filters]
=== Similarity Filters

Similarity filters are only supported in the midPoint native repository.

To perform fuzzy (not exact) matching, midPoint query language provides 2 filters: `levenshtein` and `similarity`.

Contrary to other filters, the right side of the query consists of a triplet of parameters enclosed in brackets.
Their meaning is explained in following table:

[options="header",cols="10,10,30,30",width=90]
|===
| Name | Value | Description | Parameters
| Levenshtein
| (value, threshold, inclusive)
| Matches objects for which the queried attribute has the Levenshtein distance *lower than* (or equal to, depending on the inclusive parameter value) the specified threshold.
a| * Value (string): A string value that is compared with the queried attribute.
* Threshold (integer): The compared distance value. The result must be less than (or equal to) the threshold.
* Inclusive (boolean): Defines if objects with the threshold value should be included in the result (_true_) or not (_false_).

| Similarity
| (value, threshold, inclusive)
| Matches objects for which the queried attribute has similarity *greater than* (or equal to, depending on the inclusive parameter value) the specified threshold. +
Similarity of 1 means an exact match, while 0 means no similarity.
a| * Value (string): A string value that is compared with the queried attribute.
* Threshold (float): The compared distance value. The result must be greater than (or equal to) the threshold.
* Inclusive (boolean): Defines if objects with the threshold value should be included in the result (_true_) or not (_false_).
|===

As similarity filters are implemented using https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/fuzzystrmatch.html#FUZZYSTRMATCH-LEVENSHTEIN[levenshtein PostgreSQL function] and https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/pgtrgm.html[similarity PostgreSQL function], they only work with the native repository.

`name levenshtein ("ang",2,true)`::
Matches all users whose name attribute has Levenshtein distance 2 or lower from the string "ang".

`name levenshtein ("ang",2,false)`::
Matches all users whose name has Levenshtein distance lower than 2 from the string "ang".

`name similarity ('gren', 0.5, true)`::
Matches all users whose name has similarity of 0.5 or lower from the string 'gren'.


NOTE: The Levenshtein distance between two strings is the number of modifications required to transform one string (s1) into the other string (s2). It allows for single-character edits such as deletion, insertion, and substitution. For example, for s1=“helloIndia” and s2=“halloindia,” the Levenshtein distance is 2.


=== Other Filters

[options="header",cols="10,10,30",width=70]
|===
| Name | Value | Description
| exists | N/A | Matches an item if it exists, i.e. if it has a value. This filter does not have a value.
| type | object type | Matches an object if it is of the specified type. This is usually used in combination with the `and` filter for dereferenced objects, or when you need to match a property defined in a more specific type.
|===


=== Filtering All Objects of Specified Type

Sometimes, in configuration files, you need to select all objects of a specific object type.
An example of such a case would be selecting all users in midPoint through an object collection.

To select all objects, just omit the `<filter>` element in the query, or the entire query.

The object collection below lists all roles (all objects of RoleType) in midPoint.

[source,XML]
----
<objectCollection oid="72b1f98e-f587-4b9f-b92b-72e251dbb255">
    <name>All roles</name>
    <type>RoleType</type>
</objectCollection>
----


[#_query_examples]
== Query Examples

This section provides information and examples of MQL role queries that can be utilized when configuring midPoint.

For additional examples, refer to xref:/midpoint/reference/concepts/query/midpoint-query-language/query-examples[].

=== Searching by Archetype Name

You can search for reports with an archetype using the archetype name.

.midPoint Query
----
archetypeRef/@/name = "Report export task"
----

Where `archetypeRef/@` specifies that we are not matching a reference value but its target. In this case, it is an archetype.


=== Search by Assigned Role Name

.midPoint Query
----
assignment/targetRef/@/name = "Role Name"
----

Where `assignment/targetRef/@` specifies that we are not matching a reference value but its target. In this case, it is an assigned role.


=== Users with Account on Specific Resource

You can search for users who have an account specified resource by using the default intent.

.midPoint Query
----
linkRef/@ matches (
  . type ShadowType
  and resourceRef matches (oid = "ff735c0a-21e3-11e8-a91a-df0065248d2d")
  and intent = "default"
)
----

Where:

* `linkRef/@` specifies the dereference target of `linkRef`.
This behaves similarly to SQL `JOIN` and enables you to filter properties of the target.
* `matches` specifies a subfilter for the dereferenced target, i.e. the filter that `linkRef` must match.
  ** `. type ShadowType` searches for shadows on the resource.
  This is necessary to be able to use shadow properties for the filter.
  ** `resourceRef matches (oid = "..." )` matches a specific resource to which the shadow belongs.
  ** `intent = "default"` matches the shadow with the default intent.


==== All Roles which Are Assigned to System Users

.midPoint Query using `UserType` in a referencedBy filter
----
. referencedBy (
  @type = UserType
  and @path = assignment/targetRef
  and archetypeRef/@/name = "System user"
)
----

.midPoint Query using `AssignmentType` in a referencedBy filter
----
. referencedBy (
   @type = AssignmentType
   and @path = targetRef
   and . ownedBy (
      @type = UserType
      and @path = assignment
      and archetypeRef/@/name = "System user"
   )
)
----

==== All Roles Assigned Using Inducement
The following filter is only supported in the midPoint native repository.

.midPoint Query
----
. referencedBy (
  @type = AbstractRoleType
  and @path = inducement/targetRef
)
----


==== All Roles Assigned to Administrator Using Full Text Search

.midPoint Query
----
. referencedBy (
   @type = UserType
   and @path = roleMembershipRef
   and . fullText "administrator"
)
----


==== Search Assigned Role Using Full Text Search

.midPoint Query
----
assignment/targetRef/@ matches (
   . fullText "secret"
)
----

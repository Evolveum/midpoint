//User-friendly documentation of a user-friendly language.
//This should NOT be a language specification, rather a user-oriented reference documentation with a dash of tutorial on top.

_MidPoint Query Language_ is designed to query objects in midPoint repository.
It is a universal language used to search for objects in the repository, filter objects, set up object references and so on. It is used in all the places where we need to look for an object, not only in GUI.

The language closely follows midPoint data model.
Names of the properties, attributes and all the data items are directly taken from midPoint xref:/midpoint/reference/schema/[data model].

Not all items in midPoint objects are searchable. The list of searchable items (elements) in midPoint is provided  xref:./searchable-items.adoc[here].


NOTE: The new query language is undergoing rename from 'Axiom' to 'midPoint Query Language' since midPoint version 4.8. As the Axiom name is well known, it can be still for some time referenced also with this name. Please consider _Axiom Query Language_ and _midPoint Query Language_ as synonyms.

This document provides introduction to the _midPoint Query Language_ for the users.
Some details are omitted, and there are some simplifications for clarity.
Detail developer specification of the query language is provided in xref:/midpoint/devel/axiom/[Axiom section of this site].

== The Basics

The midPoint Query Language is designed to allow specification of a complex queries.
Yet the basic structure of the language is relative simple and easy to understand.

The _query_ is a combination of a _filter_ with additional parts such as paging and sorting.
It is the _filter_ part that attracts most attention.

Simple filter usually take the usual form of `item filterName value` triple, where:

item::
  Item Path - specifies the xref:./searchable-items.adoc[searchable item] on which should be the filter applied. +
filterName::
  Name of filter to be used.
value::
  Value literal or Item Path which should be matched according filter specification.
  String needs to be enclosed in quotes (`'`) or double-qoutes (`"`)

Some examples of valid filters are:

* `fullName = "John Doe"`
* `givenName startsWith "J"`
* `activation/effectiveStatus = "enabled"`

=== Item Path

The item on which data are filtered is specified by xref:/midpoint/reference/concepts/item-path/[item path].
In its simplest form it is a name of object _property_, or names of items and containers separated by slashes. Such as:

* `fullName`
* `activation/administrativeStatus`
* `attributes/uid`

=== Filter Name
Item path is followed by filter name or its alias, which specifies which filtering condition should be used.

Following tables summarizes common property filters:

==== Comparison filters

[options="header", cols="15,10,30", width=70]
|====
| Name | Alias | Description

| `equal` | `=` | Matches if any item is equal to value
| `not equal` | != | Matches if item is different from value
| `less` | `<` | Matches if item is smaller than value
| `lessOrEqual` | `&lt;=` | Matches if item is smaller or equal to the value
| `greater` | `>` | Matches if item is greater than value
| `greaterOrEqual` | `>=` | Matches if item is greater or equal to value
|====

.Examples of comparison filters on users
`familyName = "Doe"`::
  equals filter - All users with familyName Doe
`name != "Administrator"`::
  not equals filter - Everyone except administrator
`activation/validTo < "2022-01-01"`::
  less filter - All users which will not be valid after 2021

Comparison filters also supports item path on right side of filter.
For example `activation/validFrom > activation/validTo` should return all objects with incorrectly set activations (activation start is after activation end).

==== String filters

[options="header", cols="15,10,30", width=70]
|====
| Name | Value | Description

| `startsWith` | | Matches if item starts with specified string.
| `contains` | | Matches string property if it contains specified substring.
| `endsWith` | | Matches string property if it ends with specified substring.
| `fullText` | | Performs full text search. Item path must be dot (.)
|====

=== Value

Value is usually a string literal, enclosed in double quotes.
However, value may take various forms.
For example, it may be a path of another item, e.g. in case when the query compares two items.
The value may be also quite complex.
The exact form of the value part of the filter depends on the operator.

Numeric values and QNames does not need double quotes.



=== Logical Filters

Logical filters are used to combine several sub-filters into one filter or to
negate filter.

[source,midpoint-query]
----
givenName = "John" and familyName = "Doe"
----

There is a usual set of logic operators:

.Logical Operators
[options="header", cols="10,40,30", width=80]
|====
| Operator | Example | Description

| `and`
| `givenName = "John" and familyName = "Doe"`
| All subfilters must be true.

| `or`
| `givenName = "Bill" or nickName = "Bill"`
| Any of the subfilters is true.

| `not`
| `givenName not startsWith "J"`
`givenName != "John"`
| Logical negation. Not prefixes filter name (as seen in example).

|====

You can use round brackets to group logical statements into more readable form.

----
familyName = "Doe" and (givenName = "John" or givenName ="Bill")
----

== Advanced filters


=== matches filter

`matches` filter operates on the container or structured value and specifies conditions that must be met by a single container value.
It is in form of `itemPath matches (subfilter)`, where subfilter (and item paths) are relative to the container, for example `assignment/validTo < "2022-01-01"` is same as `assignment matches (validTo < "2022-01-01")`.

The `subfilter` is any supported filter, where paths are relative to container
and allows us to specify multiple conditions (joined using <<Logical Filters>>), which must be met by container value.

Example matches filter:
----
activation matches (
  validFrom > "2022-01-01"
   and validTo <"2023-01-01"
)
----


[IMPORTANT]
====
For filters matching multiple properties of multi value containers (such as `assignment`).
It is important to consider if we want to match a container where one container value meets all criteria, or these criteria could be met by multiple different container values.

If these multiple criteria must be met by one container value you must use `matches`.

The filter `assignment/validFrom > "2022-01-01" and assignment/validTo <"2023-01-01"` is different from `assignment matches (validFrom > "2022-01-01" and validTo <"2023-01-01")`.
First will match user who has one assignment starting after 2022 and possible other assignment ending by 2023.
The second filter with match user who has an assignment which starts in 2022 and expires before 2023.
====

=== Reference Filters

Reference filters allows to match on references themselves using
<<Reference matches filter, matches>> or on properties of referenced objects using <<Dereferencing, dereferencing>>

You can also perform inverse search using <<referencedBy filter, referencedBy>> to search
for object by properties of it's referencer (e.g. search roles by properties of its members).

==== Reference matches filter

Reference itself is structured value, which contains target oid, target type and relationship type.

You can use `matches` filter with nested subfilters to target these properties of object reference:

oid::
  Exact match of target oid (UUID as string). Example: `assignment/targetRef matches (oid = efaf89f4-77e9-460b-abc2-0fbfd60d9167)`
relation::
  Matches any reference with specified relation (QName). Example: `roleMembershipRef matches (relation = manager)`
targetType::
  Matches any reference with specified target type (QName). Example: `roleMembershipRef matches (targetType = OrgType)`

It is possible to match on any combination of these three properties of reference,
but only `equals` and `and` filter are supported.

----
roleMembershipRef matches (
  oid = "bc3f7659-e8d8-4f56-a647-2a352eead720"
  and relation = manager
  and targetType = OrgType
)
----

==== Dereferencing

Dereferencing allows to write filter condition which is executed on referenced object.
Dereferencing is done using `@` special character in item path after reference, item path `assignment/targetRef/@` points to object referenced by targetRef instead of targetRef itself.
This allows you to continue path with properties of referenced objects such as
`assignment/targetRef/@/name` - which means `name` of assigned object.

For example this enables us to search for users with assigned role by role name instead of oid (but it is executed a bit slower, since we need to dereference objects).
`assignment/targetRef/@/name = "Superuser"` - matches any user who is directly assigned role of superuser.

NOTE: To match also users, who are indirectly assigned role, you should use `roleMembershipRef` instead of `assignment/targetRef`.

IMPORTANT: If you need to match referenced object on multiple properties you should use `matches` filter.

==== Dereferencing inside reference matches filter

NOTE: This feature is currently supported in midPoint 4.6 Postgres native repository only

If user wants to match on properties of reference itself and also on properties of it's target
it is possible now, using dereferencing inside `reference matches` filter.

In order to match on target you can use dereferencing and matching: `@ matches (...)`.

.Find all users, which are managers for roles with `Business Role` archetype
----
assignment/targetRef matches ( <1>
  targetType = RoleType <2>
  and relation = manager <3>
  and @ matches ( <4>
     archetypeRef/@/name = "Business Role" <5>
  )
)
----
<1> We are matching references in `assignment/targetRef`
<2> Type of referenced target should be `RoleType`
<3> Users relation to assigned role is `manager`
<4> We dereference target and match on its properties
<5> Name of role archetype should be `Business Role`. This is done by dereferencing `archetypeRef` using `@` in item path.


==== referencedBy filter

NOTE: Filter is currently supported in midPoint 4.6 Postgres native repository only

`referencedBy` filter allows you to find object based on properties on objects, which
reference it. Since object as whole is referenced the item path

In order to use `referencedBy` filter you must also specify `type` of objects, which references it,
and `path` of object reference, which is used for reference (e.g. `assignment/targetRef` or `inducement/targetRef`)

The short query syntax is:

.Find all roles which are assigned to Administrator
----
. referencedBy ( <1>
  @type = UserType <2>
  and @path = assignment/targetRef <3>
  and name = "Administrator" <4>
)
----
<1> `. referencedBy` filter name
<2> `@type` - required, special filter property which specified `type` of objects which should be considered in evaluation of filter. In this case we are interested in users.
<3> `@path` - required, special filter property which specifies which Object reference should be used in filter, in this case we are interested in directly assigned roles (`assignment/targetRef`)
<4> Filter which referencing object must match, in this case the name of referencing object must be `Administrator`.

==== ownedBy Filter

NOTE: Filter is currently supported in midPoint 4.6 Postgres native repository only

ownedBy filter allows for matching indexed containers based on properties of their parent (owning object or container).

The syntax is similar to referencedBy. ownedBy filter can only be applied on self path (`.`). The properties of ownedBy filter are:

type:: (Required) Type of parent / owner.

path:: (Optional) Name / location of container inside parent.

filter:: (Optional) Filter, to which parent needs to conform, filter is explicit element in XML/YAML/JSON. In midPoint query any filter which is not special property of ownedBy is automatically nested in filter.

.Using searchContainers, find all inducements
----
. ownedBy ( @type = AbstractRoleType and @path = inducement)
----

=== Organization Filters

Organization filters are used to filter objects based on their organization membership.
These filters operate on object as a whole, so item path must be `.` (the dot).

[options="header", cols="10,10,30", width=70]
|===
| Name | Value | Description

| inOrg | OID (UUID) | Matches if object is part of organization unit or its subunits.
| isRoot| N/A | Matches if object is organization root. Filter does not have value.
|===


`. inOrg "00000000-1eam-0000-0000-111111111111"`::
  All object which are members of specified organization
`. isRoot`::
  All roles and organization units which are organization tree roots.

=== Other filters

[options="header", cols="10,10,30", width=70]
|===
| Name | Value | Description
| exists | N/A | Matches if item exists (has any value). Filter does not have value.
| type | object type | Matches if object is of specified type. Usually used in combination with `and` filter for dereferenced objects, or it is needed to match on property defined in more specific type.

== Using midPoint Query Language in midPoint

=== Using in GUI

.midPoint 4.8 and never

Basic search query is shown above each view by default. User can switch to advanced query by clicking the query button and selecting the `Advanced` option.

.midPoint 4.5, 4.6, 4.7

Basic search query is shown above each view by default. User can switch to advanced query by clicking the query button and selecting the `Axiom query` as one of the search options.

.midPoint 4.4

New query language is experimental feature in midPoint 4.4, so it needs to be explicitly enabled in GUI.

. In Admin GUI, navigate to Configuration -> System -> Admin GUI
. Click Show Empty fields in Admin GUI Configuration section
. Select True in Enable experimental features
. Save configuration changes, logout and login in order to changes to be applied.

After logout and back login to GUI, you can click on down arrow in search field to select `Axiom query` as one of the search options.

=== Using in XML

Advanced query filters are usable in any configuration place, normal XML filters
would be used. Advanced query filter is wrapped inside `<text>`
element inside `<filter>` element.

.Example XML
[source, xml]
----
<filter>
 <text>roleMembershipRef matches (relation = manager)</text>
</filter>
----

.Example YAML
[source, yaml]
----
filter:
  text: roleMembershipRef matches (relation = manager)
----

== Motivation, Origin and Future

MidPoint Query Language was developed during xref:/midpoint/projects/midscale[midScale] project. It was formerly known as Axiom query language.
The concepts of the language are based on xref:/midpoint/devel/axiom/[Axiom data modeling].
MidPoint Query Language is replacing an old xref:../xml-query-language/[XML-based query language].
The new language is more natural, user-friendly and better aligned with foundations of xref:/midpoint/devel/axiom/[Axiom data modeling].

MidPoint Query Language was introduced in midPoint 4.3.
It was almost fully supported in midPoint 4.4 LTS, except for embedded expression.
Since midPoint 4.5, midPoint Query Language is fully supported and recommended option.

The midPoint Query Language is a full replacement for XML-based language.
The XML-based language will be still supported for some time, but it will be dropped eventually.
Users of XML-based query language should migrate to midPoint Query Language as soon as possible.

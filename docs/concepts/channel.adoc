Concept of a _channel_ defines a way or purpose of information passing in midPoint.
Every time midPoint distributes information from users to account (or vice versa) it does it within a _channel_. Channels are usually something like _synchronization_, _discovery_, _import_, _user request_, etc.
They denote *why* is the change being executed and *how* was the change detected in the first place.

Channels can be used to fine-tune midPoint functionality.
E.g. channels can be used to limit execution of certain xref:/midpoint/reference/expressions/mappings/[mappings] to specific situations.
The typical case is to limit application of xref:/midpoint/reference/expressions/mappings/inbound-mapping/[inbound mappings] only to import.
This is done by limiting the mapping to an _import channel_ and therefore it will be executed only when the accounts are imported and will not be executed for common synchronization.

Channels are identified in midPoint by URL.
There are some pre-defined URLs used internally by midPoint for common tasks such as synchronization or import.
But the deployer may choose his own URLs for other situations which are frequently used in integration scenarios.
The pre-defined channel URLs are defined in the following table.

|===
| Channel name | Description | URL

| Synchronization: liveSync
| Channel used for changes detected by Live Synchronization, the almost-realtime synchronization mechanism.
See xref:/midpoint/reference/synchronization/flavors/[Synchronization Flavors].

| Synchronization: reconciliation
| Channel used for changes detected by Reconciliation, i.e. comparing of midPoint state with resource state.
See xref:/midpoint/reference/synchronization/flavors/[Synchronization Flavors].

| Synchronization: discovery
| Channel used for changes detected by Discovery, i.e. almost-unintentional detection of changes as a side effect of other operations.
See xref:/midpoint/reference/synchronization/flavors/[Synchronization Flavors].

| Synchronization: import
| Used when importing accounts from a resource with the intent to create midPoint users.

| Recompute
| Used to recompute object without any explicit change.
Will apply policies, object template and outbound mappings for user's accounts.

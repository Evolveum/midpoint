= Event Marks
:page-toc: top
:page-since: "4.7"

MidPoint can classify individual operations, or events, by attaching one or more marks to each of them.
Examples of such a mark are "Focus activated", "Focus renamed", "Projection entitlement changed".
Some marks are available as standard initial objects, so that they can be customized, supplemented by customer-defined ones, or even removed.

Conceptually, they are related to xref:index.adoc[object marks], but the major difference is that while object marks are attached to individual _objects_ (currently, shadows), event marks are attached to _operations_ on objects (currently both focal objects and shadows).
What is common is that both object and event marks are defined using xref:/midpoint/reference/roles-policies/policy-rules.adoc[policy rules].

== List of Standard Event Marks

As of 4.7, there are the following standard event marks.

.Standard event marks
[%autowidth]
|===
| Name | Description

| Focus activated
| Marks an operation that brought the focus into existence and being effectively enabled.
(So, previously it was either non-existent or effectively disabled.)

| Focus deactivated
| Marks an operation that deleted or effectively disabled the focus.
(So, previously it existed and was effectively enabled.)

| Focus renamed
| Marks an operation that changed the focus name.

| Focus assignments changed
| Marks an operation that changed one or more of the focus assignments.

| Focus archetype changed
| Marks an operation that changed the focus archetype or archetypes.

| Focus parent organization reference changed
| Marks an operation that changed the focus parent organization reference (`parentOrgRef` item).

| Focus role membership changed
| Marks an operation that changed the focus role membership (`roleMembershipRef` item).

| Projection activated
| Marks an operation that brought the projection into existence and being effectively enabled.
(So, previously it was either non-existent or effectively disabled.)

| Projection deactivated
| Marks an operation that deleted or effectively disabled the projection.
(So, previously it existed and was effectively enabled.)

| Projection renamed
| Marks an operation that changed the name (naming attribute) of a projection.

| Projection identifier changed
| Marks an operation that changed the identifier (primary or secondary) of a projection.

| Projection entitlement changed
| Marks an operation that changed the entitlement of a projection.

| Projection password changed
| Marks an operation that changed the password of a projection.

| Resource object affected
| Marks an operation that made any change (addition, modification, deletion) to a resource object.

| Shadow classification changed
| Marks an operation that changed the classification (kind, intent) of a shadow.
Experimental.

| Shadow correlation state changed
| Marks an operation that changed the correlation state of a shadow.
The synchronization situation is considered to be part of that state.
Experimental.

== Use

In 4.7, the event marks are used exclusively in connection with xref:../../simulation/[simulations].
In the future we plan to extend their use to operations that are really executed, so they might be found in audit logs or on operational dashboards.

== Definition

Event marks are defined using standard policy rules.

----
<1> This is an archetype for event marks.
The other one is for object marks.
<2> This constraint triggers when it "sees" a modification of focus object that changes the `name` property.

Please see the initial objects for more examples.

== Introduction

Object Marks are light-weight marking mechanism for objects in order to ease administration of midPoint and/or induce specific behavior policies to marked objects.

Marked objects could be filtered by mark in Admin GUI and may receive additional policies based on effective marks.

Technically object marks are `MarkType` with archetype `Object Mark`.

IMPORTANT: Object Marks are only supported with Postgres Native Repository.

IMPORTANT: Object Marks are currently only fully supported for shadows.

== Basic Concepts

=== Effective Marks

Effective marks are marks, which are applied to object based on policies, or explicitly specified by policy statements of the object.

Effective marks are stored in object `effectiveMarkRef` of type `ObjectReferenceType` and are indexed by repository, so it is possible to use them for search.

=== Policy Statements

Effective marks could be manually added / induced / excluded from object by modifying policy statement of particular object.

A policy statement has two main properties:

* *markRef* - object reference, which specifies mark
* *type* - enumeration, which specifies type of policy statement
** `apply` - referenced mark is manually added as effective mark
** `exclude` - referenced mark will not be effective, even if other policy may specify it so.

        <!-- Protected -->
    </markRef>
    <type>apply</type>
</policyStatement>
----

== Object Operation Policy

NOTE: Currently, the object operation policy is supported for shadow objects only.

Object Marks allows to specify operation policy, which may enabled or disable specific operations for marked objects.

Currently supported object operation policies for shadows are:

[%autowidth]
|===
| Operation | Kind | Behavior if disabled

2+| `add`
| New shadows having this operation disabled cannot be added on the resource, neither manually nor automatically.
Any such attempt results in an error.
2+| `modify`
| Shadows having this operation disabled cannot be modified on the resource, neither manually nor automatically.
Any such attempt results in an error.
2+| `delete`
| Shadows having this operation disabled cannot be deleted from the resource, neither manually nor automatically.
Any such attempt results in an error.
(Except for manual deletion from GUI, where the severity of `info` is respected.)
.2+| `synchronize`
| `inbound`
| Shadows having this operation disabled are excluded from inbound synchronization.
| `outbound`
| Changes in focus objects do not trigger mappings and are not propagated to the resource.
.3+| `synchronize/membership` (applies to entitlements only)
| `inbound`
| The membership information regarding entitlement shadows having this operation disabled is excluded from inbound synchronization.
| `outbound`
| The membership information regarding entitlement shadows having this operation disabled is not propagated from focus objects to the resource.
| `tolerant`
| This is actually not an operation, but a boolean (`true`/`false`) flag that overrides whether the membership information regarding this entitlement is tolerated on the resource, if it's not provided by any mappings.
Please see xref:/midpoint/reference/resources/entitlements/#_tolerating_existing_association_values[Tolerating Existing Association Values].
|===

*Default object operation policy* for objects without marks specifying policy is to have *all operations enabled*.
This default can be changed by setting `defaultOperationPolicyRef` for specific resource object type definition.

If object has multiple effective marks specifying object operation policy, these policies are merged.
Operations disabled by any of the marks are always disabled.

The `tolerant` flag should not have values of `true` and `false` mixed together.
The current implementation is that the value of `true` is the result, should such a combination occur (with a warning into the log), but this behavior may change in the future.

[WARNING]
====
*Limitations*

- For `add`,`modify`,`delete` operations, only the `error` severity is supported.
- For all other operations, only the `info` severity is supported.
- The `synchronize/membership/inbound` is supported only for `associationSynchronization` expression evaluator.
- The `synchronize/membership/outbound` is supported only for `associationConstruction` expression evaluator.

=== Built-in Object Marks

==== Protected

Object Mark which denotes object (shadow) as Protected. Behavior of shadow marked with this mark is equivalent to setting it as protected in resource schema handling.

NOTE: In 4.7 if shadow is to be protected according to resource definition, shadow
is automatically marked `Protected` (`effectiveMarkRef`) and `objectOperationPolicy` defined in `Protected` mark enables protected behavior.

== GUI: Object Marks and Shadows

NOTE: In midPoint 4.7 object marks are only supported for shadows.

=== Marking Shadows in Resource Details

MidPoint GUI allows manually marking shadows in resource details view
using *Add Marks*, *Mark as Protected* actions in *Accounts* and *Entitlements*.

==== Workflow screenshots

.Go to Resource -> Accounts

.Click on Menu for Shadow

.Select Add Marks

.Select Marks to be added to shadow

=== Removing Shadow Marks in Resource Details

MidPoint GUI allows removing manually mark of shadows in resource details view using *Remove Marks* actions in *Accounts* and *Entitlements*.

==== Workflow screenshots
.Go to Resource -> Accounts, select accounts from which marks will be removed

.Click on Menu for Selected Shadows, Select Remove Marks

.Select Marks which should be removed from selected accounts
image::mark-shadow-remove-03.png[]

.Click Remove Marks to remove them
image::mark-shadow-remove-04.png[]

=== Marking Shadows in Simulation Results

MidPoint GUI allows manually marking shadows in Simulations results -> Processed Object views.
This is done by clicking menu icon and selecting Add Marks. Note that mark
is applied to real shadow (not simulated result). This allows for use-cases such as running simulations
and excluding particular shadows from real run.

NOTE: In Simulations GUI mark is applied to actual underlying object

==== Workflow screenshots

.Click on Menu icon for shadow

.Select Add Marks

.Select Marks and click Add
image::simulations-processed-object-04.png[]

=== Listing marked shadows across resources

In order to view all shadows marked by specific mark, you can navigate in midPoint GUI, to *Marks*, open specific object mark details and click on *Marked Shadows*.

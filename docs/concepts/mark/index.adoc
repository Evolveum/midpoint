This describes Object Marks, a midPoint feature that enables you to classify objects into groups to which you can then target policies.

== Introduction

Object Marks are light-weight marking mechanism for objects that helps you ease administration of midPoint and/or induce specific behavior policies to marked objects.

Marked objects can be filtered by marks in the Admin GUI and may receive additional policies based on effective marks.

Technically, object marks are `MarkType` with the `Object Mark` archetype.

Grouping objects with marks, and applying policies to those groups enables you to cover many business scenarios, such as:

* *Lifecycle management* - Mark users as "inactive" after a certain period of inactivity and define a policy that automatically initiates a deprovisioning process, such as revoking access rights, or archiving data, thus ensuring compliance with organizational policies.
* *Audit and compliance* - Mark objects as "under review" and set up a policy that restricts changes to those objects until a review process is complete.
* *Data protection* - Protect your imported data from being altered by marking them as "unmanaged".
* *Workflow automation* - Set up a policy that triggers specific workflows related to account setup, access provisioning, or training assignments, if a user is marked as "onboarding".

[IMPORTANT]
====
* Object Marks are only supported with Postgres Native Repository.
* Object Marks are currently only fully supported for shadows.
====

== How it works

A typical scenario in which marks are used to control the behavior of groups of objects consists of the following steps:

. Create object marks that support your use case.
. Classify objects into marked groups by assigning marks to filtered objects.
. Define the default operation policy for objects that do not have an explicitly specified mark.
. Create policies that apply to individual object marks.

TIP: See how you can xref:/midpoint/reference/admin-gui/resource-wizard/object-type/policies[classify objects and define the default operation policy in the midPoint GUI].

== Basic concepts

=== Effective marks

Effective marks are marks, which are applied to object based on policies, or explicitly specified by policy statements of the object.

Effective marks are stored in object `effectiveMarkRef` of type `ObjectReferenceType` and are indexed by repository, so it is possible to use them for search.

=== Policy statements

Effective marks could be manually added / induced / excluded from object by modifying policy statement of particular object.

A policy statement has two main properties:

* *markRef* - object reference, which specifies mark
* *type* - enumeration, which specifies type of policy statement
** `apply` - referenced mark is manually added as effective mark
** `exclude` - referenced mark will not be effective, even if other policy may specify it so.

        <!-- Protected -->
    </markRef>
    <type>apply</type>
</policyStatement>

== Object operation policy

NOTE: Currently, the object operation policy is supported for shadow objects only.

Object Marks allows to specify operation policy, which may enabled or disable specific operations for marked objects.

The supported object operation policies for shadows are:

.Supported object operation policies for shadows
[%autowidth]
|===
| Operation | Kind | Behavior if disabled

2+| `add`
| New shadows having this operation disabled cannot be added on the resource, neither manually nor automatically.
Any such attempt results in an error.
2+| `modify`
| Shadows having this operation disabled cannot be modified on the resource, neither manually nor automatically.
Any such attempt results in an error.
2+| `delete`
| Shadows having this operation disabled cannot be deleted from the resource, neither manually nor automatically.
Any such attempt results in an error.
(Except for manual deletion from GUI, where the severity of `info` is respected.)
.2+| `synchronize`
| `inbound`
| Shadows having this operation disabled are excluded from inbound synchronization.
| `outbound`
| Changes in focus objects do not trigger mappings and are not propagated to the resource.
.3+| `synchronize/membership` (applies to entitlements only)
| `inbound`
| The membership information regarding entitlement shadows having this operation disabled is excluded from inbound synchronization.
| `outbound`
| The membership information regarding entitlement shadows having this operation disabled is not propagated from focus objects to the resource.
| `tolerant`
| This is actually not an operation, but a boolean (`true`/`false`) flag that overrides whether the membership information regarding this entitlement is tolerated on the resource, if it's not provided by any mappings.
Please see xref:/midpoint/reference/resources/entitlements/#_tolerating_existing_association_values[Tolerating Existing Association Values].
|===

*Default object operation policy* for objects without marks specifying policy is to have *all operations enabled*.
This default can be changed by setting `defaultOperationPolicy` for specific resource object type definition.

If object has multiple effective marks specifying object operation policy, these policies are merged.
Operations disabled by any of the marks are always disabled.

The `tolerant` flag should not have values of `true` and `false` mixed together.
The current implementation is that the value of `true` is the result, should such a combination occur (with a warning into the log), but this behavior may change in the future.

[WARNING]
====
*Limitations*

- For `add`,`modify`,`delete` operations, only the `error` severity is supported.
- For all other operations, only the `info` severity is supported.
- The `synchronize/membership/inbound` is supported only for `associationSynchronization` expression evaluator.
- The `synchronize/membership/outbound` is supported only for `associationConstruction` expression evaluator.

=== Built-in object marks

These object marks are intended to mark objects violating various policies.

|===
| Object Mark | Description

| Assignment modified
| Assignment was modified in an illegal, suspicious or interesting way.

| Assignment state
| Assignment is in illegal, suspicious or interesting state.

| Assignment time validity
| Assignment time validity has started, ended or otherwise reached interesting point in time.

| Exclusion violation
| Violation of exclusion policy, such as segregation duty violation

| Has assignment
| Object has illegal, suspicious or interesting assignment.

| Has no assignment
| Object does not have required, recommended or interesting assignment.

| Neglected
| Mark for object that is not properly cared for, such as role that was not reviewed for a long time.

| Object modified
| Object was modified in an illegal, suspicious or interesting way.

| Object state
| Object is in illegal, suspicious or interesting state.

| Object time validity
| Object time validity has started, ended or otherwise reached interesting point in time.

| Mark for object which does not have an owner.

| Overassigned
| Excessive number of assignees. Usually indicates object assigned too many time, such as role assigned to too many users.

| Requirement violation
| Violation of requirement policy, such as insufficient clearance

| Suspicious
| Mark for Suspicious object. It should be (manually) investigated.

| Underassigned
| Unsifficient number of assignees. Usually indicates shortage of staff, vacancies or other understaffing situations.

| Understaffed security
| Mark for security role or responsibility which is not properly staffed, it is not assigned to the users according to policy.

=== Shadow policy marks

Automatic marking of shadows with shadow policy marks can be configured in xref:/midpoint/reference/concepts/mark/managed-and-unmanaged-shadows/#marking-rules[resource schema handling].

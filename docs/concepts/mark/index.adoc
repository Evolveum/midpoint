== Introduction

Object Marks are light-weight marking mechanism for objects in order to ease administration of midPoint and/or induce specific behavior policies to marked objects.

Marked objects could be filtered by mark in Admin GUI and may receive additional policies based on effective marks.

Technically object marks are `MarkType` with archetype `Object Mark`.

IMPORTANT: Object Marks are only supported with Postgres Native Repository.

IMPORTANT: Object Marks are currently only fully supported for shadows.

== Basic Concepts

=== Effective Marks

Effective marks are marks, which are applied to object based on policies, or explicitly specified by policy statements of the object.

Effective marks are stored in object `effectiveMarkRef` of type `ObjectReferenceType` and are indexed by repository, so it is possible to use them for search.

=== Policy Statements

Effective marks could be manually added / induced / excluded from object by modifying policy statement of particular object.

A policy statement has two main properties:

* *markRef* - object reference, which specifies mark
* *type* - enumeration, which specifies type of policy statement
** `apply` - referenced mark is manually added as effective mark
** `exclude` - referenced mark will not be effective, even if other policy may specify it so.

        <!-- Protected -->
    </markRef>
    <type>apply</type>
</policyStatement>
----

== Object Operation Policy

NOTE: Currently, the object operation policy is supported for shadow objects only.

Object Marks allows to specify operation policy, which may enabled or disable specific operations for marked objects.

Currently supported object operation policies for shadows are:

[%autowidth]
|===
| Operation | Kind | Behavior if disabled

2+| `add`
| New shadows having this operation disabled cannot be added on the resource, neither manually nor automatically.
Any such attempt results in an error.
2+| `modify`
| Shadows having this operation disabled cannot be modified on the resource, neither manually nor automatically.
Any such attempt results in an error.
2+| `delete`
| Shadows having this operation disabled cannot be deleted from the resource, neither manually nor automatically.
Any such attempt results in an error.
(Except for manual deletion from GUI, where the severity of `info` is respected.)
.2+| `synchronize`
| `inbound`
| Shadows having this operation disabled are excluded from inbound synchronization.
| `outbound`
| Changes in focus objects do not trigger mappings and are not propagated to the resource.
.3+| `synchronize/membership` (applies to entitlements only)
| `inbound`
| The membership information regarding entitlement shadows having this operation disabled is excluded from inbound synchronization.
| `outbound`
| The membership information regarding entitlement shadows having this operation disabled is not propagated from focus objects to the resource.
| `tolerant`
| This is actually not an operation, but a boolean (`true`/`false`) flag that overrides whether the membership information regarding this entitlement is tolerated on the resource, if it's not provided by any mappings.
Please see xref:/midpoint/reference/resources/entitlements/#_tolerating_existing_association_values[Tolerating Existing Association Values].
|===

*Default object operation policy* for objects without marks specifying policy is to have *all operations enabled*.
This default can be changed by setting `defaultOperationPolicy` for specific resource object type definition.

If object has multiple effective marks specifying object operation policy, these policies are merged.
Operations disabled by any of the marks are always disabled.

The `tolerant` flag should not have values of `true` and `false` mixed together.
The current implementation is that the value of `true` is the result, should such a combination occur (with a warning into the log), but this behavior may change in the future.

</objectOperationPolicy>

[WARNING]
====
*Limitations*

- For `add`,`modify`,`delete` operations, only the `error` severity is supported.
- For all other operations, only the `info` severity is supported.
- The `synchronize/membership/inbound` is supported only for `associationSynchronization` expression evaluator.
- The `synchronize/membership/outbound` is supported only for `associationConstruction` expression evaluator.

=== Built-in Object Marks

These object marks are intended to mark objects violating various policies.

Objects can be manually marked using xref:/midpoint/reference/concepts/mark/manual-marking/#object-marks[midPoint GUI].

|===
| Object Mark | Description

| Assignment modified
| Assignment was modified in an illegal, suspicious or interesting way.

| Assignment state
| Assignment is in illegal, suspicious or interesting state.

| Assignment time validity
| Assignment time validity has started, ended or otherwise reached interesting point in time.

| Exclusion violation
| Violation of exclusion policy, such as segregation duty violation

| Has assignment
| Object has illegal, suspicious or interesting assignment.

| Has no assignment
| Object does not have required, recommended or interesting assignment.

| Neglected
| Mark for object that is not properly cared for, such as role that was not reviewed for a long time.

| Object modified
| Object was modified in an illegal, suspicious or interesting way.

| Object state
| Object is in illegal, suspicious or interesting state.

| Object time validity
| Object time validity has started, ended or otherwise reached interesting point in time.

| Orphaned
| Mark for object which does not have an owner.

| Overassigned
| Excessive number of assignees. Usually indicates object assigned too many time, such as role assigned to too many users.

| Requirement violation
| Violation of requirement policy, such as insufficient clearance

| Suspicious
| Mark for Suspicious object. It should be (manually) investigated.

| Underassigned
| Unsifficient number of assignees. Usually indicates shortage of staff, vacancies or other understaffing situations.

| Understaffed security
| Mark for security role or responsibility which is not properly staffed, it is not assigned to the users according to policy.

=== Shadow Policy Marks

Automatic marking of shadows with shadow policy marks can be configured in xref:/midpoint/reference/concepts/mark/managed-and-unmanaged-shadows/#marking-rules[resource schema handling].

Shadow Policy Marks can be also assigned manually using xref:/midpoint/reference/concepts/mark/manual-marking/#shadow-policy-marks[midPoint GUI].

|Yes
|Shadow object which can not be correlated automaticly and should be skipped during synchronization.

|*Do not touch*

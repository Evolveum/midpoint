MidPoint is using internal mechanism based on relative changes.
This is a unique feature that is distinguishing midPoint from vast majority of other IDM systems that are based in absolute changes.


== Problems of Absolute Change Model

Traditional IDM systems works with absolute change model.
They write a complete set of new values for every change.
E.g. the change message can look like "user A has roles X, Y and Z now".

The absolute change model used by other IDM systems has many drawbacks in the identity management deployments:

* The data records must be *locked*, otherwise consistency is lost.
Locking is very difficult to implement reliably in loosely-coupled distributed environment that is typical for IDM deployments.

* It is almost impossible to execute several operations in *parallel*. For example, if addition of role X to user A is being approved, no other role change can be executed on user A. Approvals may take a long time (days, weeks) and locking user record for such a long time is a major obstacle to usability of IDM deployments.

* *Local changes* on the managed systems are in danger.
The absolute change model works in read-change-write cycles.
If a local change happens between read and write it will be overwritten even if it was not in conflict with the IDM change.
The connectors does not have any locking mechanisms to provide better consistency.
But even if the connector interface supported locking, some system does not support it therefore this approach would still fail for some systems.
And even if all the systems supported locking, there is still the problem with long-running processes such as approvals.

Consistency and especially parallelism of operations is a major issue in other identity management systems based on the absolute change model.
Such systems require constant maintenance and attention of IDM administrator, failing to provide the expected ROI.
Limited usability of such system is also a major obstacle to adoption.


== Relative Change Model

MidPoint works with relative changes if possible.
That means it works with concepts such as "role X was added to user A" instead of "user A has roles X, Y and Z now".
MidPoint usually conveys only the information what was changed, does not transfer entire state.
This goes down even to the level of individual attribute values.
For example, adding a new role to a user only affects a single value of role assignment property.
The rest of the user record is unaffected by this operation and therefore does not need to be locked.
Also, other roles can be assigned to or revoked from the user at the same time, improving system usability.
A very straightforward way of conflict-free merging of several operations is possible.

This approach has substantial advantages:

* *No locking* is necessary in common case.
Relative operations can be merged with other operations.
Optimistic locking can be used in the rare cases that a stricter consistency is needed.

* *Parallelism* is not limited.
As operations can be merged, several processes can run in parallel using the same object.

* The risk of *local change* damage is limited.
Systems that natively support relative changes (e.g. LDAP) or traditional locking mechanisms (e.g. databases) do not risk conflict with local changes.
The impact on other systems is very limited, as the duration of read-change-write cycle is very short (milliseconds).

* *Robustness.* The operations can be cached and re-tried lated.
As the operation does not contain absolute state the side-effects of the operation are limited.
This provides better tolerance to the failures of managed systems.

As the consistency model is weak, there is still a small chance of inconsistency.
Reconciliation mechanism is designed to handle such a rare cases.
However, in the relative change model reconciliation is only a supplementary mechanism and does not need to be executed as frequently.
Also, reconciliation in midPoint is designed to be seamlessly integrated with other synchronization mechanisms such as live sync, discovery and ordinary provisioning.
All these mechanisms are using the same interfaces and policies, therefore configuring reconciliations is much easier than it used to be in other IDM systems.

Relative change model is not an invention of midPoint.
Similar approach is used in one of the most successful identity management technology of all times: LDAP.
The LDAP protocol is using similar change propagation and weak consistency model and we have chosen to reuse this proven model instead of re-inventing the wheel.


== Limitations

While midPoint is built with relativity in mind, this relativity is not complete.
MidPoint evolution, and especially financial and scheduling constraints, forced us to make compromises during midPoint development.
This does not affect correctness of midPoint computation, but it may affect performance.
The deployments that rely on a lightweight processing of large number of small changes may be affected.

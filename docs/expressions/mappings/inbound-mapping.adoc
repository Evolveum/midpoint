== Introduction

Inbound mapping is a xref:/midpoint/reference/expressions/mappings/[mapping] that transforms data from a xref:/midpoint/reference/schema/focus-and-projections/[projection] (e.g. an account) on the resource side to a xref:/midpoint/reference/schema/focus-and-projections/[focal object] (e.g. a user) on the midPoint side.
Therefore it maps data in the direction which points _into_ midPoint.
Hence _inbound_ mapping.
Inbound mappings are usually used to copy and transform data from authoritative sources to midPoint.
E.g. inbound mappings are often used to populate new user object with data from HR system.

Please see the xref:/midpoint/reference/synchronization/introduction/[Synchronization] page for a generic description of the synchronization process and the specific place where inbound mappings are used.


== Input

Value constructions are sometimes used in situations where an input of the construction is quite obvious.
In such cases the input is placed into a variable named `input` for easier use.
This is common practice e.g. in inbound expressions or in expressions describing synchronization of account activation and password.

<script>
  <code>'The Mighty Pirate ' + input</code>

== Association

The inbound mapping for association allows you to manage group membership.
As the example below shows, inbound can be defined in resource schema handling in the association part.
All midpoint's expression can be used.
In the following example the assignmentTargetSearch is used.
According to the group in which user's take a membership the assignment will be constructed.
The prerequisite is that each known group has it's corresponding role in midPoint.
After applying search filter the role is found and it is assigned to the user.

                    <script>
                        <code>
                            import com.evolveum.midpoint.schema.constants.*
                            import com.evolveum.midpoint.xml.ns._public.common.common_3.RoleType;

                            if (assignment.target != null) {
                                return assignment.target.roleType == 'auto'
                            }

                            if (assignment.targetRef != null) {
                                role = midpoint.getObject(RoleType.class, assignment.targetRef.oid)
                                return ('auto')?.equals(role.roleType)
                            }
                        </code>
                    </script>
                </condition>
            </set>
        </target>
    </inbound>
       <kind>entitlement</kind>
       <intent>group</intent>
       <direction>objectToSubject</direction>
       <associationAttribute>ri:members</associationAttribute>
       <valueAttribute>icfs:name</valueAttribute>
</association>
----

In the example below there is a script expression _return 'Auto' + entitlement?.getName()?.getNorm()_ which tells midPoint which role should be assigned to the user.
The _entitlement_ is a special variable pointing to the ShadowType representing group on resource.
This variable is available only for script expression in the relativity mode relative.
In other cases when there is a need to resolve ShadowType for a group there is a method in midpoint function library which can be used.
This method is shown in example below.

.Resolving ShadowAssociationForGroup
[source,xml]
----
groupShadowType = midpoint.resolveEntitlement(input);
----

This is another example of inbound mapping.
It derives role name from the `cn`  LDAP attribute of the group.
There are two differences to the above example:

. Roles are created on demand here.
It provides additional resilience.

. Assignments maintained by this mapping are marked by `ldap-group`  subtype; instead of marking based on roles' subtype.
This is more efficient, because it does not require `getObject`  repository call on evaluation.
(Also, the behavior is slightly different: here you can have assignment to a role bound to LDAP group, which is maintained manually, independently of assignments managed by this mapping.)

                     or reconciliation) on LDAP group objects, but it is possible that this mapping is evaluated

== Range Of Inbound Mappings

Inbound mappings have their range - as all the mappings have.
Range is a set of possible values that a mapping can produce.
This is an important tool to control which values are to be replaced by the mapping - or better to say, which values should be replaced.
See xref:/midpoint/reference/expressions/mappings/[] page for the details.

The default range of inbound mappings depend on the target item:

[%autowidth]
|===
| Mapping target is | Default range | Which means ...

| single-value
| `all`
| The target value will be replaced.
This is nice and intuitive behavior for single-value items.
This is also known as _non-tolerant _behavior.


| multi-value
| `none`
| Target values will *not*  be replaced.
This is safe behavior for multi-value items as the chance to delete something is lower.
This is also consistent with other mappings, where the default range is empty.
This is mostly intuitive for many multi-valued items, such as assignments - even though it may not be a natural fit everywhere.
But it is consistent behavior, therefore it was chosen as a default. +
This is also known as _tolerant_ behavior.


|===

The default behavior can be overridden by explicit definition of mapping range, as you can see on a following example.

[source,xml]
----
    <inbound>
        ... sources, expression, etc.
        <target>
            <path>organization</path>
            <set>
                <predefined>all</predefined>
            </set>
        </target>
    </inbound>
----

See xref:/midpoint/reference/expressions/mappings/range[] page for a detailed discussion of mapping ranges.

[TIP]
.Motivation
====
The concept of range is not needed that often in other mappings.
But it makes a lot of issues in inbound mappings.
The reason for that is that inbound mappings are somehow different.
They are not completely xref:/midpoint/reference/concepts/relativity/[relativistic].

Typical midPoint mapping is working with a xref:/midpoint/devel/prism/concepts/deltas/[deltas]. The mapping knows what was changed and the mapping takes a full advantage of that.
Therefore it will normally not change the things that should not be changed.
Therefore the definition of mapping range is not that important in such case.
However, in inbound mappings we do not usually have a delta.
We just have the state of the resource object (e.g. account) as it is now.
We do not know what was changed.
Therefore we have to recompute all the values.
But the real difficulty here is to know which values to remove.
E.g. if mapping target is an assignment, how do we know which assignments are given by this mapping and which are assigned automatically? The mapping should remove those that are given by the mapping, but it should not touch other assignments.
This is exactly what range definition does.

For the future, there is an easier and perhaps more intuitive method.
But that requires remembering the origin (provenance) of each value that midPoint maintains.
Fortunately, such feature is planned: xref:/midpoint/features/planned/data-provenance/[Data Provenance]. If you are interested in this please consider xref:/support/subscription-sponsoring/[purchasing platform subscription].

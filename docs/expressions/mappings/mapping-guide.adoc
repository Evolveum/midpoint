== Introduction

_Mapping_ is a mechanism that is used at many places through midPoint to map value of a source property (or properties) to a target property.
It is a very flexible mechanism that allows to use expressions (including scripting), direct variable references, value generators and other _evaluators_ for the value.
It is used for example in xref:/midpoint/reference/expressions/mappings/outbound-mapping/[outbound mapping], xref:/midpoint/reference/expressions/mappings/inbound-mapping/[inbound mapping], xref:/midpoint/reference/roles-policies/assignment/[assignments], xref:/midpoint/reference/roles-policies/rbac/[roles] and so on.


=== The Basics

Mapping definition consists of the three basic parts:

* *Source* part defines the data sources of the mapping.
These are usually understood as mapping input variables.
Source defines where mapping gets its data.

* *Expression* part defines how the data are transformed, generated or passed on to the "other side".
This is the most flexible part of the mapping as it contains logic.
There is a broad variety of possibilities that are described in the xref:/midpoint/reference/expressions/expressions/[Expression] page.

* *Target* part defines what to do with the results of the mapping, where the computed values should go.

The three parts of the mapping as well as the basic principle is illustrated in the following figure:

The figure shows simple mapping that takes `employeeNumber` user property and transforms it to `description` account attribute by using a simple Groovy script expression.

The source part of the mapping defines that there is a single source which is based on `employeeNumber` user property.
Source definitions are important for the mapping to correctly process relative changes (deltas), mapping dependencies, etc.
The source definition tells mapping that the value of `employeeNumber` user property should be passed to an expression.

The expression part contains a simple Groovy script that prepends the prefix `emp#` to the employee number value specified by the source definition.
The expression part of the mapping is very flexible and there is a lot of way that can be used to transform a value, generate new value, use a fixed value, pass a value without any change and so on.
Because expressions are so flexible they are documented in a separate xref:/midpoint/reference/expressions/expressions/[Expression] page.

The target part defines how the result of the expression should be used.
In this case the result is to be used as a `description` account attribute.
The target definition is necessary so the mapping can locate appropriate definition of the target property and therefore make sure that the expression produces a correct data type (e.g. string vs xref:/midpoint/reference/concepts/polystring/[polystring] and that other schema constraints are maintained (e.g. single vs multiple values).

This example mapping can be expressed in XML using the same structure:

.Simple mapping
[source,xml]
----
<mapping>
    <source>
        <path>$focus/employeeNumber</path>
    </source>
    <expression>
        <script>
            <code>'emp#' + employeeNumber</code>
        </script>
    </expression>
    <target>
        <path>$projection/attributes/description</path>
    </target>
</mapping>
----

Not all parts of the mapping are mandatory.
If the expression is not present then a "as is" expression is assumed that just copies the source to target without any change.
Some parts of the mapping may be implicitly defined by the surrounding context, e.g. the target is implicit in xref:/midpoint/reference/expressions/mappings/outbound-mapping/[outbound mapping definition]. Similarly a source is implicitly defined in xref:/midpoint/reference/expressions/mappings/inbound-mapping/[inbound mapping]. Therefore for outbound and inbound mappings it is usually sufficient to define either source or target:

.Simple outbound and inbound mapping
[source,xml]
----
<attribute>
    <ref>ri:sn</ref>
    <outbound>
        <source>
             <path>$focus/familyName</path>
        </source>
    </outbound>
    <inbound>
        <target>
             <path>$focus/familyName</path>
        </target>
    </inbound>
</attribute>
----

Both source and target are implicit in outbound/inbound mappings of standard properties such e.g. inside `activation` or `credentials` containers.
Therefore the very minimal form of mapping definition is an empty mapping which copies implicit source to the implicit target without any change:

.Empty outbound mapping
[source,xml]
----
<outbound/>

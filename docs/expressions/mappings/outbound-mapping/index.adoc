== Introduction

Outbound mapping define how the data are xref:/midpoint/reference/synchronization/introduction/[synchronized] from the user to accounts or, in other words, when the data *out* of midPoint.
See xref:/midpoint/reference/synchronization/examples/[Synchronization Examples] for a generic explanation of the synchronization mechanism.

== Expressions
Outbound expressions are defined in the xref:/midpoint/reference/resources/resource-configuration/schema-handling/[schema handling] section of resource definition.
The expression definition is inside attribute definition which is inside account type definition:

[source,xml]
----
<resource>
  ...
  <schemaHandling>
    ...
    <objectType>
      ...
      <attribute>
        ...
        <outbound>
          <initial>true</initial>
          <expression>
            <code>
              concat('uid=', $c:focus/c:name, ',ou=people,dc=example,dc=com')
            </code>
          </expression>
        </outbound>
        ...
      </attribute>
      ...
    </objectType>
    ...
  </schemaHandling>
  ...
</resource>

== Variables

Outbound expressions usually take variables from the system variables provided by midPoint when the expression is evaluated.
Following table summarizes the variables available to outbound expressions.

[%autowidth]
|===
| Variable name | Type | Description

| `focus` +
_root node_
| Subclasses of FocusType
| Represents xref:/midpoint/reference/schema/focus-and-projections/[focal object] which is typically a user.
This is the most common source of data for outbound expressions.


| `iteration`
| integer
| Numeric value describing the current iteration.
It starts with `0` and increments on every iteration.
Iterations are used to find unique values for an account, to resolve naming conflicts, etc.


| `iterationToken`
| string
| String value describing the current iteration.
It is usually suffix that is appended to the username or a similar "extension" of the value.
It should have different value for every iteration.
The actual value is determined by the iteration settings.

== Troubleshooting

=== Accounts are skipped during reconciliation
*Problem*

During a reconciliation, accounts that have newly been created in midPoint are not added to the target resource.
This happens to accounts with attributes that cannot be set upon creation.

*Cause*

Attributes that cannot be set upon creation require two steps - first creating, and only then modifying.
However, some connectors may not be able to combine the Add and Modify operations.
As a result, when you add a new account in midPoint with attributes that cannot be modified upon creation, such connectors will not be able to both create and set the attributes during a reconciliation, and they will not add the new account in the target resource at all.

*Workaround*

Define a condition in the troublesome outbound mapping that makes sure the mapping is ignored, and that adds a trigger for a recomputation at a later point, during which the attribute will be modified.
This way, adding accounts to the target resource will not be interrupted during the reconciliation, and the attribute will be added during a subsequent recomputation.
By default, recompute operations are scheduled to occur every 5 minutes.

== Resource and Role Attribute Mappings

Resource attribute can be set by several means: manually specified in midPoint user interface, produced by a mapping in a role or in xref:/midpoint/reference/resources/resource-configuration/schema-handling/[resource schema handling]. MidPoint is designed to automatically merge all the values produced by mappings.
This approach is quite clear when applied to multi-valued attributes, where all the results of all mappings are combined together.
But it is a different story for single-valued attributes.
Only one value can be a result and it is not that obvious how several mappings are combined to produce the value.
The following table provides a summary of the values are produced.
The table corresponds to the following scenario:

* CSV resource

* Resource schema mapping to an attribute setting the value to False

* Role schema mapping to the same attribute setting the value to True

* Resource assigned to a user thus creating an account on the CSV resource

* Role assigned to user

* Role unassigned from user

The Resource and Role columns show the strength and authoritative settings for the attribute.
The Resultant Value columns show the attribute value on the resource after adding the role and removing the role.

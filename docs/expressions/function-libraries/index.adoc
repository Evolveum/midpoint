== Overview

Function libraries are dedicated midPoint objects that contain set of reusable functions.
The functions can be used in other xref:/midpoint/reference/expressions/[mappings and expressions] in midPoint.
Function libraries can be used to group frequently-used parts of the code, therefore simplifying midPoint configuration and maintenance.

== Configuration

Please see xref:configuration.adoc[] page for configuration details.

= Expression Profiles Coverage

The coverage by expression profiles is *NOT COMPLETE*.

This means that even if an object has attached an expression profile through its archetype, the profile may not be consistently applied to all expressions present in that object.

== Supported Profiles

=== Bulk Actions

Explicitly *supported* profiles are the following ones:

. Profiles for bulk actions in task templates.
. Profiles for bulk actions in policy rules in objects: both in conditions and actions of these rules.
. Profiles for bulk actions entered via GUI ("Bulk actions" page) and via REST ("/rpc/executeScript").

This means that the specified profiles are applied to bulk actions and any expressions contained in them for these cases.

NOTE: The reference above means the test method(s) that check that the profiles are really applied.
It is obviously not a proof of correctness and/or completeness of the implementation, just a reminder that it was tested to some degree.

== Profiles Supported Experimentally

As an *experimental feature*, expressions profiles (EPs for short) are supported also at the following places:

// NOTE: The `autoassign/focus/selector/filter` does not need expression profiles, because expressions are not supported at that place.
// See `test110RestrictedRoleAutoFilterExpression`.

=== Mappings

The whole mapping evaluation (including the "main" expression, condition, value set expressions, and so on) is driven by `expressionProfile` in `AbstractMappingImpl` class.
(The fact that really all the expressions are supported is a question of thorough testing and/or code analysis.)

This field is set when the class is instantiated, and is determined from the mapping origin, using `ExpressionProfileManager.determineExpressionProfileStrict` method that does not accept unknown or external origins.

So, the crucial thing is to identify the origin of a mapping correctly.

Currently, the mappings can be used in the following places #TODO fill the table#:

[%authowidth]
|===
| Ident | Place | Description | Status | Path | Reference

| `[EP:M:IM]`
| inbound mappings
| Inbound mappings come from the particular resource.
| OK (Except for resource inheritance.)
| attribute, association, and auxiliary object class definitions
|

| `[EP:M:OM]`
| outbound mappings
|
| OK (Except for resource inheritance.)
|

|
|

| `[EP:M:AAFM]`
| auto-assignment focus mappings

| OK
|
|

| `[EP:M:TFM]`
| template focus mappings
|

|
|

.2+| assignment or role condition
.2+| The assignment and role conditions are evaluated as mappings.
.2+| OK

| assignment condition
|

| role condition
|

.2+| `[EP:M:PRC]`
.2+| policy rule condition
.2+| The policy rule conditions are evaluated as mappings.
.2+| OK

| `systemConfiguration:globalPolicyRule/condition`
| not needed

| `mark:policyRule/condition`
| #TODO#

| `[EP:M:MM]`
| metadata mapping
| This is experimental functionality, anyway.
| OK (Not sure about object template inclusion, though.)
|
|

| `[EP:M:Tag]`
| shadow tags
| (Outbound) shadow tags are computed as mappings.
| OK (Except for resource inheritance.)
|
|

|===

The status of `OK` means that the code was checked for compliance.
However, no guarantees can be provided at this time.

==== Limitations

Configuration items in resources are currently determined without taking resource inheritance into account.
See also bug:MID-9018[].

The effects of object template inclusion are unclear. See e.g. [EP:M:MM].

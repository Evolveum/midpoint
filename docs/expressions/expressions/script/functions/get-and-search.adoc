= Getting and Searching Objects

The xref:/midpoint/reference/expressions/expressions/script/functions/midpoint/[midPoint Script Library] provides capabilities to get and search objects from scripts.


The provided get and search related functions are:


* Query Building Functions - allows to write xref:midpoint/reference/concepts/query/midpoint-query-language/query-language-in-groovy/[queries using midPoint Query Language].

* Get Object Functions - Allow to get object using `type` and `oid` of the object.
* Search Object Functions - Allows to search objects using `type` and `query`

These capabilities are useful, and sometimes necessary, but their overuse may affect performance.  


== Performance Optimizations

Since midPoint 4.9 Native Repository splitted most full objects into components, which allows only to exclude paths, which are not needed for script logic. 
For backwards compatibility these items are returned by default, but if it is necessary it is possible to exclude them from results. 

The getObject, searchObjects, and searchObjectsIterative can be called with additional argument `options`, which provides more specific options, how to fetch data.

IMPORTANT: Partially readed objects (objects with exclusion) should not be used as base for new objects (added to repository), they are mostly intended for read-only use cases. 

NOTE: Returned objects may contain excluded data, if the underlying object was not yet stored splitted (in case of Native Repository) or these options are used for Generic Repository. 

=== Fetching only base properties

.Excluding all separatelly stored subitems
[source, groovy]
----
def query = midpoint.queryFor(UserType.class, "roleMembershipRef/@/name = 'Administrator'"); // <1>
def options = midpoint.onlyBaseObject(); // <2>
def administrators = midpoint.searchObjects(query , options); // <3>
----
<1> Query for users with Administrator role
<2> Options, which exludes all separatelly stored items
<3> Search of users, which fetches only basic data, based on `options`


=== Excluding Specific Items

The APIs allows, you to exclude specific items not needed for script using `midpoint.getOperationOptionsBuilder()`.
This is script friendly shorthand for `SchemaService.get().getOperationOptionsBuilder()`.

.Excluding roleMembershipRef and operationExecution items
[source, groovy]
----
def query = midpoint.queryFor(UserType.class, "roleMembershipRef/@/name = 'Administrator'"); // <1>
def options = midpoint.getOperationOptionsBuilder() // <2>
                .item(UserType.F_ROLE_MEMBERSHIP_REF).dontRetrieve() // <3>
                .item(UserType.F_OPERATION_EXECUTION).dontRetrieve() // <4>
                .build(); // <5>

def administrators = midpoint.searchObjects(query , options); // <6>
----
<1> Query for users with Administrator role
<2> We create builder using `GetOperationOptionsBuilder`
<3> Instruction to not retrieve `roleMembershipRef`
<4> Instruction to not retrieve `operationExecution`
<5> We build options
<6> Search using provided `options`

= MidPoint standard functions
:page-nav-title: Standard functions

The `MidpointFunctions` interface defines the built‑in functions that are automatically available to every midPoint expression, script, and mapping.
These functions expose the core model operations (object creation, retrieval, modification, search, workflow, cryptography, etc.) as a concise, script‑friendly API.
All functions are public members of the interface;
they can be invoked directly from an expression code (e.g., Groovy, JavaScript, etc.) without importing any additional classes.

*The functions are available in link:https://github.com/Evolveum/midpoint/blob/master/model/model-api/src/main/java/com/evolveum/midpoint/model/api/expr/MidpointFunctions.java[MidpointFunctions.java]*

[NOTE]
====
*Notes on generic placeholders and overloads*

* Generic type parameters (`<T>` and `<F>`)
    ** `<T extends ObjectType>` is used for methods that operate on any concrete midPoint object type (e.g., `UserType`, `RoleType`, `OrgType`).
        The caller supplies the concrete class via a `Class<T>` argument, and the method returns a value of that same type, preserving compile‑time type safety.
    ** `<F extends FocusType>` is a specialization of `<T>` for focus objects (objects that can have assignments, projections, and a lifecycle), such as users, org units, and services.
        Methods that manipulate focus‑specific data (e.g., `recompute`, `isDirectlyAssigned`) use `<F>` to signal that the operation is only applicable to focus types.
    ** The placeholder name (`T` or `F`) is irrelevant to the runtime;
        it merely conveys the intended category of objects and enables the compiler to enforce correct usage.
* Var‑args (`...`) versus collection overloads
    ** Methods that accept a var‑args parameter (e.g., `executeChanges(ObjectDelta<? extends ObjectType>... deltas)`) allow callers to pass any number of arguments directly, without constructing a collection first.
        Internally the compiler creates an array, so the call is convenient for a small, known number of deltas.
    ** The corresponding collection overload (`executeChanges(Collection<ObjectDelta<? extends ObjectType>> deltas)`) is intended for scenarios where the deltas are already assembled in a `List`, `Set`, or another `Collection`. It avoids the extra array allocation that the var‑args version would incur and is more appropriate for bulk or dynamically built delta sets.
    ** Both overloads perform the same operation; the choice is purely a matter of API ergonomics and performance considerations. The var‑args version is annotated with `@SuppressWarnings("unchecked")` because Java cannot create a generic array at runtime, while the collection version does not have that limitation.

|====
|Function name |Input arguments |Return type |Description

|createEmptyObject
|Class<T> type
|T
|Creates an empty prism object of the given type. The method constructs the object only in the memory. If you intend to create an object in repository or on the resource you need to populate this object with data and then invoke the `addObject` or `executeChanges` method.
|createEmptyObjectWithName
|Class<T> type, String name
|T
|Creates an empty prism object of the given type with a String name. Same limitations as to `createEmptyObject` apply.
|createEmptyObjectWithName
|Class<T> type, PolyString name
|T
|Creates an empty prism object of the given type with a PolyString name. Same limitations as to `createEmptyObject` apply.
|createEmptyObjectWithName
|Class<T> type, PolyStringType name
|T
|Creates an empty prism object of the given type with a PolyStringType name. Same limitations as to `createEmptyObject` apply.
|resolveReference
|ObjectReferenceType reference
|T
|Resolves a reference to an object. Throws an exception if the reference is not found.
|resolveReferenceIfExists
|ObjectReferenceType reference
|T
|Resolves a reference if it exists. Returns null when the reference is not found.
|getObject
|Class<T> type, String oid, Collection<SelectorOptions<GetOperationOptions>> options
|T
|Returns object for provided OID. It retrieves the object from an appropriate source for an object type (e.g. internal repository, resource or both), merging data as necessary, processing any policies, caching mechanisms, etc. This can be influenced by using `options`.
|getObject
|Class<T> type, String oid
|T
|Returns object for provided OID. It retrieves the object from an appropriate source for an object type (e.g. internal repository, resource or both), merging data as necessary, processing any policies, caching mechanisms, etc.
|executeChanges
|Collection<ObjectDelta<? extends ObjectType>> deltas, ModelExecuteOptions options
|void
|Execute the provided object deltas with options influencing processing of the deltas. The order of execution is not defined and the implementation is free to determine the correct or most suitable ordering. All deltas must relate to analogous objects (e.g. user and linked accounts). The implementation may throw an error if the objects are not analogous. The implementation also implicitly links the objects (mark them to be analogous) if such a link is part of the data model. E.g. the implementation links all accounts to the user if they are passed in a single delta collection. This is especially useful if the account deltas are ADD deltas without OID and therefore cannot be linked explicitly. Only one delta per object is accepted. The OID provided in ADD deltas should be empty under usual circumstances.
|executeChanges
|Collection<ObjectDelta<? extends ObjectType>> deltas
|void
|Execute the provided object deltas. The order of execution is not defined and the implementation is free to determine the correct or most suitable ordering. All deltas must relate to analogous objects (e.g. user and linked accounts). The implementation may throw an error if the objects are not analogous. The implementation also implicitly links the objects (mark them to be analogous) if such a link is part of the data model. E.g. the implementation links all accounts to the user if they are passed in a single delta collection. This is especially useful if the account deltas are ADD deltas without OID and therefore cannot be linked explicitly. Only one delta per object is accepted. The OID provided in ADD deltas should be empty under usual circumstances.
|executeChanges
|ObjectDelta<? extends ObjectType>... deltas
|void
|Execute the provided object deltas. The order of execution is not defined and the implementation is free to determine the correct or most suitable ordering. All deltas must relate to analogous objects (e.g. user and linked accounts). The implementation may throw an error if the objects are not analogous. The implementation also implicitly links the objects (mark them to be analogous) if such a link is part of the data model. E.g. the implementation links all accounts to the user if they are passed in a single delta collection.

This method has a very limited scaling capability as all the results are stored in the memory. DO NOT USE on large datasets. Recommended usage is only when using queries that cannot return large number of results (e.g., queries for unique values) or when combined with paging capability. For other cases use `searchObjectsIterative` instead.

|Executes an ad‑hoc provisioning script on the given resource.
|isEvaluateNew
|
|Boolean
|A stateful flag that tells a script whether it is currently handling a new value—one that will be written to the target object (e.g., values from the add/replace sections of an `ObjectDelta` or recomputed values slated for persistence)—or an old value—one that is being removed or read from the existing object (e.g., values from the delete section). It returns `true` for new, `false` for old, and `null` when the framework cannot determine the distinction or the context does not apply. The method never throws; it reflects the evaluation mode of the active script execution, and can be used in mapping or provisioning scripts to branch logic based on whether the processed data will become part of the target or be discarded. A usage may be: `if (midpoint.isEvaluateNew()) { /* prepare new value */ } else { /* handle old value */ }`.

|getFocusesByCorrelationRule
|Class<F> type, String resourceOid, ShadowKindType kind, String intent, ShadowType shadow
|List<F>
a|Legacy name for `findCandidateOwners()`. There are some slight changes in semantics comparing to midPoint 4.5:

* If `kind` is `null`, `ACCOUNT` is assumed.
* If `intent` is `null`, `default` is assumed.
* The use of `type` parameter is a bit different.
* Instead of being limited to correlation/confirmation expressions, the method now invokes the standard correlation mechanism. See findCandidateOwners(Class, ShadowType, String, ShadowKindType, String) for more information.
*
* The original method returns `null` e.g. if there's no synchronization policy, etc.  So, this method treats all exceptions (except for SchemaException) by returning `null`.

= Upgrade with ninja
:page-toc: top

== Introduction

This document describe how to upgrade midPoint installation using tool called ninja.
More overall information about ninja can be found xref:./index.adoc[here].
Ninja supports two different upgrade paths:

* *Feature release upgrade* - from previous version to next one (e.g. 4.7 -> 4.8)
* *LTS upgrade* - from previous LTS to next one (e.g. 4.4 -> 4.8)

Deployment has to be upgraded to latest maintenance release before it can be upgraded to next version using ninja.

For concrete examples of upgrade scenarios, please see <<Upgrade procedure examples>>.

== Upgrade procedure overview

Upgrade procedure consists of two main phases with several steps.
First phase (preparation) can be executed while midPoint is still running, without any interruption of service.
Second phase (upgrade) requires downtime of midPoint instance.
This phase should be quick to minimize required downtime.
All steps mentioned above are described in following sections, ninja will guide you through them.
For concrete examples of upgrade scenarios, please see <<Sample upgrade scenarios>>.

. *Preparation phase*
.. Read release notes for the new midPoint version / for all intermediate midPoint versions between your current and the new midPoint version (this is especially important for LTS to LTS upgrade)
.. <<Upgrade tasks to use activities>>
.. <<Pre-upgrade check>>
.. <<Verification & upgrade objects>>
//.. Review verification results
//.. Run upgrade objects (based on verification results)
.. <<Download distribution>>
. *Upgrade phase*
.. Stop midPoint
.. <<Upgrade DB schema>>
.. <<Upgrade installation,Upgrade midPoint installation>>
.. <<Initial objects,Update initial objects>>
.. Start midPoint
.. <<Verify connector references in resources>>

== Upgrade procedure examples

Following chapter contains few examples on how to upgrade midPoint using ninja.
First part describes how to set up midPoint instance for upgrade scenarios.

There are three examples:

* <<Automatic upgrade>>
* <<Manual (sequential) upgrade>>
* <<Container environment upgrade>>

Variables used in examples:

* `$MP_INSTALLATION` - MidPoint installation directory

////
=== Example setup

Following chapter describe how to setup midPoint instance using ninja for example upgrade scenarios.
Setup is for "old" midPoint version:

* last 4.4.x (after 4.4.5, or snapshot build from support-4.4)
* last 4.7.x (after 4.4.1, or snapshot build from support-4.7)

==== Steps

. Download https://download.evolveum.com/midpoint/4.4.6/midpoint-4.4.6-dist.zip[4.4.6 zip distribution]
.. Alternatively https://download.evolveum.com/midpoint/4.7.2/midpoint-4.7.2-dist.zip[4.7.2 zip distribution]
. Unzip to installation directory (`$MP_INSTALLATION`)
. Install and start PostgreSQL 14/15
. Create database and user for midPoint
+
.create-database.sql

$MP_INSTALLATION/bin/ninja.sh run-sql \
--mode repository \
--create

$MP_INSTALLATION/bin/ninja.sh run-sql \
--mode audit \
--create

  --jdbc-username midpoint44 \
  --jdbc-password midpoint44 \
  --mode audit \
  --create
----

. Start midPoint and populate it with data (ideally containing deprecated/removed elements)
////

=== Automatic upgrade

This is the simplest way to upgrade midPoint distribution.

. (Update your tasks to use activities before continuing.)
. Shutdown midPoint
. Run distribution upgrade
+
[source,bash]
----
$MP_INSTALLATION/bin/ninja.sh -v upgrade-distribution \
  --temp-directory $MP_INSTALLATION/tmp \
  --backup-midpoint-directory \
----
+
TIP: [.purple]#You can also point ninja to already downloaded zip file using `--distribution-archive` option.#

+
TIP: You could use `--distribution-version{nbsp}latest` option to upgrade to an unreleased midPoint version (latest SNAPSHOT)

. Check your start-up script for midPoint: if you are using systemd or a custom script referring to `midpoint.war`, you need to replace the reference with `midpoint.jar`. See also xref:/midpoint/install/systemd/[Running midPoint with systemd].

. Start midPoint

=== Manual (sequential) upgrade

Manual upgrade allows for customization of each step done during upgrade procedure via custom options.
Following example is almost equivalent to simple `upgrade-distribution` command described above, but split into multiple separate commands.

. (<<Upgrade tasks to use activities,Update your tasks to use activities before continuing>>.)

. Run pre-upgrade check (refer to <<Pre-upgrade check>> for more details and options)
+
[source,bash]
----
$MP_INSTALLATION/bin/ninja.sh -v pre-upgrade-check
----
+
NOTE: Currently, this step only informs that there are X critical and other errors,
but doesn't return error code and fail whole script.
User has to make sure there are no critical errors and only then continue with next step.

=== Container environment upgrade

This chapter describes how to upgrade midPoint using ninja in container environments, e.g. deployments in Kubernetes, Docker.

Ninja in container environment can be accessed by using midPoint container started in interactive mode.
`$CURRENT_VERSION` in following command is version of midPoint that is currently running.

Container used to run ninja has to be started with same parameters as midPoint containers in deployment.
Environment variables or config maps or other configuration has to be passed to container the same way as to midPoint containers.
This is necessary to make sure that ninja uses same resources.
Another case when this is necessary is if database connection configuration is not present in `$MIDPOINT_HOME/config.xml`, but passed via parameters.

[source,bash]
----
docker run -ti --rm [-env VARIABLE=VALUE] -w=/opt/midpoint evolveum/midpoint:$CURRENT_VERSION /bin/bash
----

After container starts we're presented with bash prompt.
Now we can run ninja as in non-container environment, e.g.:

. Example printout of ninja version
[source,bash]

==== Upgrade procedure for container environment

Upgrade procedure is very similar to non-container environment, differences will be described in following sections.

*Preparation phase* is the same as for non-container environment:

* <<Upgrade tasks to use activities>>
* <<Pre-upgrade check>>
* <<Verification & upgrade objects>>

*Upgrade phase can't* be executed using simple `upgrade-distribution` command due to differences in handling of installation directory.
Following steps has to be executed instead:

* Stop current midPoint containers
* <<Setup ninja using new midPoint image>>
* <<Upgrade DB schema (container environment)>>
* <<Initial objects (container environment)>>
* <<Upgrade midPoint containers>>
* Start new midPoint containers

==== Setup ninja using new midPoint image

New midPoint image has to be pulled from Docker Hub before upgrade procedure can be started.
`$NEXT_VERSION` in following command is version of midPoint that is going to be used after upgrade.
At the time of writing it's `4.8`.

As previously mentioned <<Container environment upgrade, here>>, container used to run ninja has to be started with same parameters as midPoint containers in deployment.

[source,bash]
----
docker pull evolveum/midpoint:$NEXT_VERSION

docker run -ti --rm [-env VARIABLE=VALUE] -w=/opt/midpoint evolveum/midpoint:$NEXT_VERSION /bin/bash
----

Now we're presented with bash prompt, new version of ninja can be used to upgrade midPoint.

==== Upgrade DB schema (container environment)

Database schema has to be upgraded by starting new midPoint image in interactive mode and running `run-sql` command.

[source,bash]
----
# upgrade DB schema of midPoint repository
./bin/ninja.sh run-sql \
  --mode repository \
  --upgrade

# upgrade DB schema of midPoint audit repository
./bin/ninja.sh run-sql \
  --mode audit \
  --upgrade
----

==== Initial objects (container environment)

Initial objects can be updated using ninja started withing new midPoint image in interactive mode.
As for the update itself, <<Initial objects>> chapter describes how to review and update initial objects.

==== Upgrade midPoint containers

Now is the time to update definition of midPoint containers in deployment.
This means we should update configuration in `docker-compose.yml` when using Docker compose command, or stateful set in Kubernetes or any other related container configuration for midPoint cluster.
`$NEXT_VERSION` version of `evolveum/midpoint` image must be used.

Containers can be started.
MidPoint in new version should start.

Please review logs of midPoint containers to make sure there are no errors.











== Upgrade procedure details

=== Upgrade tasks to use activities

Task objects in midPoint before 4.4 were using configuration mostly through handlerUri and arbitrary extension elements.
With release 4.4 this has changed, better configuration schema was introduced with new task concept called activity.
Most of the tasks without activities will not work in 4.8 (or newer) and have to be updated to use activities.
Few internal types of tasks (e.g. related to certifications will still work with old configuration).
Migration of tasks should be therefore done before upgrade procedure is started.

Ninja currently doesn't support task migration out of the box.
MidPoint Studio plugin with Intellij Idea will be able to help with migration of tasks.

More information about task migration can be found in xref:/midpoint/reference/tasks/activities/migration/[Migration of Tasks from 4.0/4.3 to 4.4] section of midPoint documentation.

=== Pre-upgrade check

Pre-upgrade check is a simple check that verifies that current midPoint version matches version of distribution that is going to be upgraded.
There are two items being checked:

* database schema version
* midPoint cluster nodes version

==== Database schema version check

This check verifies that database schema version matches supported version.
Database schema version is stored in `m_global_metadata` table and separate version is stored for midPoint repository and audit.
Schema version check can be skipped if necessary using option `--skip-database-version-check`.

==== Nodes version check

This check verifies that all nodes in midPoint cluster have the same version and that version is eligible for upgrade.
Nodes version check can be skipped if necessary using option `--skip-nodes-version-check`.

.Example of how to do pre-upgrade check
[source,bash]
----
./bin/ninja.sh pre-upgrade-check \
  --skip-nodes-version-check
----

=== Verification & upgrade objects

Verification is a process that reads objects from midPoint repository and checks whether they are compatible with new version of midPoint.
Verification checks for deprecated, removed elements or other issues that can cause problems during or after upgrade.

Different categories for verification can be set turned on via switch `--verification-category [DEPRECATED|REMOVED|PLANNED_REMOVAL|INCORRECT_OIDS]`.
By default, all categories are checked.

Verification can run while midPoint is running.
The whole verification can be split into multiple parts, each part verifying a subset of similar objects using `-f, --filter` and `-t, --type` options.
This way verification reports can be simpler to read and easier to understand, since they should contain smaller set of issues.

Verification results can be reported in two styles plain and CSV.
The switch for report style is `--report-style [plain|csv]`.
Plain style is set as default option, while CSV is better for further processing and review.
CSV report style creates two files - CSV and XML.
XML will contain list of deltas for each object, describing what ninja wants to change on object to _upgrade_ it.

The CSV report contain three sets of columns:

* Object identification (oid, name, type)
* Verification item information (status, path, message)
* Upgrade information

==== Upgrade information

Upgrade information consists of following columns:

* *Identifier* - unique identifier of verification/upgrade item which can be used to group similar items together when processing reports.
* *Phase* - upgrade phase in which item should be updated (before or after midPoint is upgraded).
* *Priority*
** *Critical* - midPoint may fail to start or work properly if such verification item is not fixed (updated).
Critical item would also halt upgrade procedure in next phase, unless this check is explicitly skipped using `--skip-verification` option.
** *Necessary* - verification item should be fixed, midPoint should not fail to start, but some features might not work properly.
** *Optional* - this item doesn't have to be necessarily fixed, but it's recommended to do so.
E.g. deprecated configuration which might be removed in version after next one.
* *Type*
** *Seamless* - such item can be handled by ninja automatically without any user interaction.
E.g. there's clear migration path without any change in functionality.
** *Preview* - ninja can provide new configuration for such item, but it's recommended to review it before applying.
** *Manual* - ninja can't provide any configuration for such item, user has to fix it manually.
Reason can be that there's currently no migration path (removed feature) or there are multiple possible solutions that doesn't map configuration 1:1.
* *Description* - contains more information, mainly on how to upgrade/update such item.
* *Skip* - last column in CSV report, can be used to mark items that should be skipped during object upgrade.
Such CSV report has to be used as input for upgrade objects command with option `--verification-file`.

Objects can be upgraded by using CSV report from verify:
//Report only needed if there are objects/items to be skipped:

[source,bash]
----
./bin/ninja.sh upgrade-objects \
  --verification-file verify-output.csv --report-style csv

=== Download distribution

Download distribution is simple step that helps you download specific version of distribution of midPoint.
Midpoint distribution is downloaded from https://download.evolveum.com/midpoint/[download.evolveum.com].

By default, next version of midPoint is downloaded based on current version.
E.g. for feature release 4.7.1, next version is 4.8 and for LTS upgrade from 4.4.6 ninja will download 4.8 as well.

Version which should be downloaded can be specified using `--distribution-version` option.
Use `latest` to specify latest build to be downloaded (at the time of writing it's `4.8-SNAPSHOT`).

User can also provide custom build downloaded or built separately (e.g. using maven overlay) using switch `--distribution-archive <PATH_TO_ZIP>`.
This switch is useful mainly in compound command `upgrade-distribution` where user can use distribution located on filesystem without need to download it.

.Example of how to download distribution (default next version based on the current midPoint)
[source,bash]
----
./bin/ninja.sh download-distribution \
  --temp-dir $SCRIPT_DIR/.upgrade \
  --distribution-directory $SCRIPT_DIR/.upgrade/new-distribution
----

.Example on how to download specific version of distribution (latest snapshot)
[source,bash]
----
./bin/ninja.sh download-distribution \
  --temp-dir ./tmp \
  --distribution-version latest \
  --distribution-directory ./tmp/latest-distribution
----

=== Upgrade DB schema

Database schema changes are handled by SQL scripts that are bundled with distribution in folder `doc/config/sql/native/*.sql`.
These changes can be applied using ninja command `run-sql`.
User can use `--mode [repository|audit]` switch together with `--upgrade` to run proper scripts automatically or use `--scripts` option to specify custom set of scripts.

Run-sql command can be used also to create database schema from scratch using switch `--create`.

Ninja by default uses repository/audit configuration from _midpoint-home/config.xml_ to connect to database.
This behaviour can be changed via `--jdbc-url`, `--jdbc-username` and `--jdbc-password` options.
With these options, ninja will switch to _raw_ mode, create custom JDBC connection and execute scripts on it.

If `--result` switch is used, ninja will print results for each query in script to SYSOUT, otherwise results are ignored.

.Example uses of run-sql command
[source,bash]
----
# runs custom-upgrade-database.sql script on JDBC connection specified by url/username/password
./bin/ninja.sh run-sql \
  --jdbc-url jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/postgres \
  --jdbc-username postgres \
  --jdbc-password postgres \
  --scripts ./custom-upgrade-database.sql

# runs upgrade scripts for repository on database defined in midpoint-home/config.xml
./bin/ninja.sh run-sql \
  --mode repository \
  --upgrade

# runs upgrade scripts for repository on database defined in midpoint-home/config.xml
./bin/ninja.sh run-sql \
  --mode audit \
  --upgrade

# runs custom defined scripts for audit on database defined in midpoint-home/config.xml
./bin/ninja.sh run-sql \
  --mode repository \
  --scripts ./upgrade/new-distribution/doc/config/sql/native/postgres-upgrade.sql
----

=== Upgrade installation

Upgrade installation step will copy and replace files in midPoint installation directory using files from distribution.
By default, installation directory is computed as a parent of midpoint-home directory.
This behavoiour can be changed using `--installation-directory <PATH>` option.

All files that would be replaced can be backed up if necessary using `--backup-installation-directory <path>` option.

=== Initial objects

This is the last step of upgrade procedure while midPoint is still down.
It is necessary to update initial objects to make sure that they are compatible with new version of midPoint and midPoint can start and work properly.

IMPORTANT: When upgrading LTS (from 4.4 -> 4.8) it is necessary to upgrade at least securityPolicy object.
Reason for this is that there were changes in authentication/authorization processing for different channels and configuration related to it, hence securityPolicy.
See <<Important updates>> for more details.

Ninja contains command `initial-objects` to help you update set of initial objects (see `ninja.sh help initial-objects` for more details).
Initial objects command will help add, update or replace existing objects in repository.

All necessary objects are bundled in directly in ninja, however, it is possible to use custom set of new initial objects using `--file` option.
`--file` options can be used multiple times or have multiple values separated by comma to specify multiple directories/files.

Ninja also supports filtered processing using `--type`, `--oid` and `--reverse-oid-filter`/`--reverse-type-filter`.
Such options give you possibility to process only subset of objects using this command.
E.g. replace objects without custom changes without any merge, reports or dry-run while reviewing merged objects with custom changes.

This command also supports dry-run mode and reporting.
Dry-run mode can be used to see what changes will be done in repository without actually doing them (option `--dry-run`).
Reporting can be turned on using `-r, --report` options.
Report option can be coupled with `--report-style [DELTA|FULL_OBJECT]` to specify whether XML output should contain only deltas or full objects after update.
There's also standard set of options to send output to file (`-o, --output`) and overwrite (`-O, --overwrite`).

NOTE: Initial objects that are new in upgraded version of midPoint are not added to repository by ninja automatically.
By default, these objects will be properly imported during first start of upgraded midPoint.
If one wants to import them before first start, it is possible to use `--force-add` option.

WARNING: Merging algorithm used in this ninja command is experimental and might not work properly in all cases.
Please review all changes proposed by ninja using `--dry-run` before applying them to repository.

There are two main scenarios that can be followed:

* <<No changes in initial objects>>
* <<Custom changes in initial objects>>

==== No changes in initial objects

This one is the simplest case.
If there are no custom changes in initial objects made by users, then ninja can update initial objects automatically.
Update can be done by overwriting existing ones without merge.
Following command can be used (please use `--dry-run` if you want to see what will be done without actually doing it):

[source,bash]
----
./bin/ninja.sh initial-objects --no-merge
----

==== Custom changes in initial objects

If there are custom changes in initial objects made by users, then ninja can help you merge them.
First, dry run is recommended to see what needs to be done, optionally with report of changes:

[source,bash]
----
./bin/ninja.sh initial-objects --dry-run --report --report-style FULL_OBJECT -o report-initial-objects.xml
----

If you're satisfied with changes proposed by ninja, you can execute command without `--dry-run` and report related options.
If there are objects (filtered by types or oids) that can be handled without merge, you can run:

[source,bash]
----
./bin/ninja.sh initial-objects --no-merge [--type securityPolicy,valuePolicy,...] [--oid 93ae3cd3-b34d-4093-ad49-adba573a95ba]
----

==== Important updates

There is at least one object - securityPolicy that needs to be updated when upgrading LTS from 4.4 to 4.8.
If there are no custom changes in securityPolicy, following command can be used:

[source,bash]
----
./bin/ninja.sh initial-objects --no-merge --type securityPolicy
----

// TODO TODO TODO what if I was using other than Default Security Policy?
// TODO TODO TODO GUI auth works, but REST (Studio) will not work

=== Verify connector references in resources

After midPoint upgrade, built-in connector versions might have been changed.
Your existing resources in midPoint might stop work.
Please review your resources using built-in midPoint connectors and update `connectorRef` references to point to the new connector versions.

Ninja is a command line tool bundled with midPoint.
Implemented features are based on "repo-ninja", but code was rewritten from the ground up.
This tool comes in handy when one needs to export or import objects from/to midPoint.
Operations can be done on top of repository (DB) layer or through REST API.
Access through DB layer can be very powerful, especially in cases when UI fails.
For example when midPoint fails to start because of configuration issue or objects data corruption.
Another great example is "administrator" user lockout.

Users of this tool need to be aware that using repository layer, access is not validated using
authorisations, model component is not used during processing and changes are not audited.
It allows you to obtain or modify data in an otherwise unusable midPoint.
Ninja also supports some other operations like listing keys from keystore, enforcing objects
reencryption with new key, DB schema validation, password reset or user unlock.

Ninja can be started using standard `java -jar` or via bundled shell/bat script.
Bundled shell and bat scripts are located in the midPoint installation directory, e.g. `<midpoint>/bin/ninja.sh`.
Bundled scripts will automatically fill in path to for xref:/midpoint/reference/deployment/midpoint-home-directory/[midPoint home]
option `-m` using `MIDPOINT_HOME` environment variable, defaulting to the `<midpoint>/var`.

== Connecting to midPoint

Connection options:

* using `${midpoint.home}`
* using REST service (not yet implemented)

=== midpoint.home connection

This type of connection initialises repository layer of midPoint and operates on top of the database.
For all commands that communicate with DB layer `${midpoint.home}` must be specified using `-m <path>` option.
Ninja will try to read database connection information from `config.xml`.
This will not work when there's only datasource definition in `config.xml` (no JDBC url/username/password).
In such chase one have to specify URL (`-U`), username (`-u`) and password (`-p` or `-P`).
These options can also be used to override JDBC URL, username and password specified in `config.xml`.

With bash, you can provide environment variable `MIDPOINT_HOME` for the `ninja.sh` command with this shortcut:

[source,bash]
----
MIDPOINT_HOME=/var/other-mp-home <midpoint>/bin/ninja.sh [general options] [command] [command options]
----

=== JDBC Driver

Only JDBC driver that is bundled is for PostgreSQL database.
This means that for other databases, you must provide JDBC driver yourself.
Most of the time JDBC driver is already present in `<midpoint>/lib` directory.
However, it will not be picked up automatically, and you must point ninja to it explicitly.
Example when using `java -jar`:

[source,bash]
----
java -Dloader.path=<jdbc_driver_jar_path> -jar ninja.jar [general/connection options] [command] [command options]
----

If the bundled scripts are used, you can specify the path to the driver with `-j` option, for example:

[source,bash]
----
<midpoint>/bin/ninja.sh -j <jdbc_driver_jar_path> [general/connection options] [command] [command options]
----

== Supported operations

Ninja currently supports these operations:

* <<Count>>
* <<Delete>>
* download-distribution (midPoint 4.4.6, 4.7.2, 4.8 or later)
* <<Export>>
* export-audit (midPoint 4.4.1 or later)
* export-mining (midPoint 4.4.4 or later)
* <<Help>>
* <<Import>>
* import-audit (midPoint 4.4.1 or later)
* info
* <<Keys>>
* pre-upgrade-check (midPoint 4.4.6, 4.7.2, 4.8 or later)
* run-sql (midPoint 4.4.6, 4.7.2, 4.8 or later)
* trace (midPoint 4.4.6, 4.7.2, 4.8 or later)
* upgrade-distribution (midPoint 4.4.6, 4.7.2, 4.8 or later)
* upgrade-installation (midPoint 4.4.6, 4.7.2, 4.8 or later)
* upgrade-objects (midPoint 4.4.6, 4.7.2, 4.8 or later)
* Verify (midPoint 3.9 or later)

=== Count

Count command counts objects in midPoint repository.
It can count all objects or objects filtered by type (`-t, --type`) and filter (`-f, --filter`).
Result is printed to `SYSOUT` separately for each object type and total count.

.Example of counting all objects in the repository
[source,bash]
----
./bin/ninja.sh count
----

=== Delete

Delete command deletes objects from midPoint repository.
Objects which should be deleted can be filtered in several ways:

* by oid (`--oid`)
* type (`-t, --type`) and filter (`-f, --filter`)

Additionally, there is option to confirm each delete operation (`-a`, `--ask`).

=== Export

Export command allows users to export objects.
Object can be exported to `SYSOUT` or to file (`-o`, `--output`) and compressed using ZIP if needed (`-z`, `--zip`).
Export also support multi-threading (`-l`, `--multi-thread`).
Use `-O`, `--overwrite` switch if you wish to overwrite an existing output file.
Objects exported from midPoint can be filtered in several ways:

* by oid (`--oid`)
* by type (`-t, --type`) and filter (`-f, --filter`)

[WARNING]
When exporting shadow objects from midPoint `-r (--raw)` option must be used to export data correctly.
Raw option will add schema for shadow attributes (to be used in import later on).
Behavior without raw option will export shadow attribute without schema because of backward compatibility.

.Example of export to compressed zip file using 4 threads:
[source,bash]
----
./bin/ninja.sh export -O export.zip -z -l 4
----

=== Help

Help command prints help for specific command or all commands.
When printing help for all commands, it will print general option and lists all commands.

.Example of printing help for all commands
[source,bash]
----
./bin/ninja.sh help
----

When printing help for specific command, it will also print usage and all options for that command.

.Example of printing help for specific command
[source,bash]
----
./bin/ninja.sh help export
----

=== Import

Import command allow users to import objects to midPoint.
Objects can be read from `SYSOUT` or file (`-i`, `--input`) and uncompressed using ZIP if needed (`-z`, `--zip`).
Import also support multi-threading (`-l`, `--multi-thread`).
Use `-O`, `--overwrite` switch if you wish to overwrite existing objects in midPoint.
Object read from input (file or sysout) can be filtered in several ways:

* by oid (`--oid`)
* by type (`-t, --type`) and filter (`-f, --filter`)

.Example of import from XML file using 4 threads with raw and overwrite option
[source,bash]
----
./bin/ninja.sh import -O -i midpoint/samples/objects/user-ceresnickova.xml -l 4 -r
----

=== Verify

Command that verifies objects in midPoint repository.
It displays warnings about objects to `SYSOUT` or file.
Similarly to export, one can define oid, multiple types or filter to filter verified objects.
Simple usage to verify all objects in the repository for all warnings:

.Example which verifies all objects in repository, checks all warnings
[source,bash]
----
./bin/ninja.sh verify
----

There is a `-w` switch that can be used to select specific warnings to display.
Currently, it only supports values deprecated and plannedRemoval.
Following command will show warnings about planned removal of items used by all objects in the repository:

.Example which verifies all objects in repository, checks only planned removal of items
[source,bash]
----
./bin/ninja.sh verify --verification-category planned_removal
----

=== Keys

Command that lists keys from keystore defined in `${midpoint.home}/config.xml` using `keystore/keyStorePath`.
Password for keys can be filled in using `-k <PASSWORD>` or `-K` to ask for password interactively.

.List keys in with aliases from keystore located in `${midpoint.home}`
[source,bash]
----
./bin/ninja.sh keys -K
----

=== Audit export/import

[NOTE]
Audit export/import uses the same format as objects, even utilizing `<objects>` element,
but audit records are *containers, not objects*.
These files are only useful for Ninja import/export, do not try to use them in Studio or otherwise.

.Example: audit export to a zipped file, overwriting any existing file, using an Axiom filter
[source,bash]
----
ninja.sh exportAudit -o audit-export.xml.zip -z -O -f '%timestamp < "2021-12-01"'
----

Now you can move the exported file to a new environment and run the import:

.Example: audit import
[source,bash]
----
ninja.sh importAudit -i audit-export.xml.zip -z
----

Check also the xref:/midpoint/reference/repository/native-audit/#audit-migration-from-other-database[migration guide for the Native audit].

=== Role mining export/import

[NOTE]
Role mining export is an anonymized export of relationships between roles, users, and
organizations. The goal of the export is to obtain a map of relations between objects, which could
be helpful in the development of new features such as "Role mining".
For detailed information regarding role mining export, please refer to the
xref:/midpoint/reference/roles-policies/mining/anonymous-data-export/#anonymous-export-of-role-mining-data[Anonymous Export of Role Mining Data].

.Example: role mining export to a `zipped` file, `overwriting` any existing file. `SEQUENTIAL` name mode and `ADVANCED` security by default. For exporting in JSON format, rename the exported file extension to `-o role-mining-export.json`.
[source,bash]
----
ninja.sh export-mining -o role-mining-export.xml.zip -z -O
----

----
java -jar ninja.jar -m <midpoint.home> export-mining -o role-mining-export.xml.zip -z -O

----

.Example: role mining export using `ENCRYPTED` name mode and  `STANDARD` security.
[source,bash]
----
ninja.sh export-mining -o role-mining-export.xml.zip -z -O -nm ENCRYPTED -s STANDARD
----

.Example: role mining export using an `Axiom filter` for roles.
[source,bash]
----
ninja.sh export-mining -o role-mining-export.xml -fr '% name != "Superuser"'
----

.Example: role mining export using `ORIGINAL` name mode, identifiers Application and Business role `prefixes/suffixes` and specific `archetypes oids`.
[source,bash]
----
ninja.sh export-mining -o role-mining-export.xml  -nm ORIGINAL -arp "APP_ROLE_, AR-" -ars "_Apr" -brp "BUS_ROLE_" -brs "_BR" --business-role-archetype-oid "e9c4654e-c146-4b5f-8336-2065c65060df" --application-role-archetype-oid "52b8361a-c955-4132-97a4-77ff3820beeb"
----

.Example: role mining export with `disable organization` structure export.
[source,bash]
----
ninja.sh export-mining -o role-mining-export.xml --disable-org
----

.Example: role mining import.
[source,bash]
----
java -jar ninja.jar -m <midpoint.home> import -O -i <path_to_imported_file> -l 4 -r
----

== Other scenarios

=== Administrator unlock

Ninja does not provide unlock or password reset operations explicitly.
Normally administrator can do this via GUI.
It may happen that administrator locks out itself from the system, in which case we recommend to reinitialize the object:

.Administrator object refresh from the initial object
[source,bash]
----
ninja.sh import --input <midpoint>/doc/config/initial-objects/050-user-administrator.xml --overwrite
----

Now, this is rather a drastic measure - let's modify the existing user instead.
First we need to export it.

[NOTE]
If you want to use Ninja for midPoint running with H2 database (which is sensible only for testing), the application must be stopped first.
Other databases have dedicated servers and Ninja can be used while midPoint is running.

.Exporting administrator user by OID
[source,bash]
----
ninja.sh export --oid 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000002 --output admin.xml
----

Alternatively, you can use type option and filter to specify name
(don't forget the `--overwrite` option, if the file already exists):

.Exporting user by name
[source,bash]
----
ninja.sh export --type user --filter '% name = "administrator"' --output admin.xml
----

Now is the time to carefully edit the object XML.
If a single object is in the XML (which is our case), you can remove the `<objects>` wrapper element.
This may actually help with code completion if xref:/midpoint/tools/studio/[midPoint Studio] is used.

Typical fixes to shape up the uncooperative user object are:

* Remove `administrativeStatus` and `effectiveStatus` elements from the top-level `activation`
element (be sure not to modify `activation` under `assignments` inadvertently).
This should fix any problems with disabled user.
* If you forgot the password, change the whole content of the `credentials/password/value` element
to this snippet (must be inside the `value` element):
+
[source,xml]
----
<t:clearValue>asdf1234</t:clearValue>
----

After the fixes, it's time to push the object back into the repository.
Import process can handle both plain object or objects inside `<object>` container.
Use the following command:

.Importing the fixed user object
[source,bash]
----
ninja.sh import --input admin.xml --overwrite
----

Now you should enjoy easy administrator login.
Of course, this works for any user object, but using the GUI with working administrator is the way to go.

[IMPORTANT]
If you changed the password in this way, don't forget to change it immediately to something more solid.
This will also properly encrypt it in the object representation, as expected.

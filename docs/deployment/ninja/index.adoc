[NOTE]
====
Since midPoint 4.8. Also in 4.4.6, 4.7.2 and later.

* Commands and options names realigned:
** All command and option names are kebab cased
** File output is now `-o, --output`
** `-O, --overwrite` for all commands

Ninja is a command line tool bundled with midPoint.
Implemented features are based on "repo-ninja", but code was rewritten from the ground up.
This tool comes in handy when one needs to export or import objects from/to midPoint.
Operations can be done on top of repository (DB) layer or through REST API.
Access through DB layer can be very powerful, especially in cases when UI fails.
For example when midPoint fails to start because of configuration issue or objects data corruption.
Another great example is "administrator" user lockout.

Users of this tool need to be aware that using repository layer, access is not validated using
authorisations, model component is not used during processing and changes are not audited.
It allows you to obtain or modify data in an otherwise unusable midPoint.
Ninja also supports some other operations like listing keys from keystore, enforcing objects
reencryption with new key, DB schema validation, password reset or user unlock.

Ninja can be started using standard `java -jar` or via bundled shell/bat script.
Bundled shell and bat scripts are located in the midPoint installation directory, e.g. `<midpoint>/bin/ninja.sh`.
Bundled scripts will automatically fill in path to for xref:/midpoint/reference/deployment/midpoint-home-directory/[midPoint home]
option `-m` using `MIDPOINT_HOME` environment variable, defaulting to the `<midpoint>/var`.

== Connecting to midPoint

Connection options:

* using `${midpoint.home}`
* using REST service (not yet implemented)

=== midpoint.home connection

This type of connection initialises repository layer of midPoint and operates on top of the database.
For all commands that communicate with DB layer `${midpoint.home}` must be specified using `-m <path>` option.
Ninja will try to read database connection information from `config.xml`.
This will not work when there's only datasource definition in `config.xml` (no JDBC url/username/password).
In such chase one have to specify URL (`-U`), username (`-u`) and password (`-p` or `-P`).
These options can also be used to override JDBC URL, username and password specified in `config.xml`.

With bash, you can provide environment variable `MIDPOINT_HOME` for the `ninja.sh` command with this shortcut:

[source,bash]
----
MIDPOINT_HOME=/var/other-mp-home <midpoint>/bin/ninja.sh [general options] [command] [command options]
----

=== JDBC Driver

Only JDBC driver that is bundled is for PostgreSQL database.
This means that for other databases, you must provide JDBC driver yourself.
Most of the time JDBC driver is already present in `<midpoint>/lib` directory.
However, it will not be picked up automatically, and you must point ninja to it explicitly.
Example when using `java -jar`:

[source,bash]
----
java -Dloader.path=<jdbc_driver_jar_path> -jar ninja.jar [general/connection options] [command] [command options]
----

If the bundled scripts are used, you can specify the path to the driver with `-j` option, for example:

[source,bash]
----
<midpoint>/bin/ninja.sh -j <jdbc_driver_jar_path> [general/connection options] [command] [command options]
----

== Supported operations

Documentation for supported commands is available xref:./command/index.adoc[here].

== FAQ

=== Can I use ninja from midPoint 4.8.* distribution with deployment running midPoint 4.4.*?

No, ninja 4.8 internally uses repository (DB) implementation from midPoint 4.8
MidPoint 4.4.* has differences in DB schema compared to midPoint 4.8.
Technically it is possible to run ninja 4.4.7 against midPoint 4.4.2 for example since DB schema didn't change between these versions.
However, this is not recommended and not supported.

=== Why raw (`-r`, `--raw`) option is needed when exporting objects?

Raw option will tell ninja to export objects together with their definitions if needed.
These definitions are used to import objects back to midPoint.
For more information see xref:./command/export.adoc[].

$ java -jar target/ninja.jar help
Usage: java [-Dloader.path=<jdbc_driver_jar_path>] -jar ninja.jar [options] [command] [command options]
  Options:
    -B, --batch-mode
      Run in non-interactive (batch) mode (disables output color).
      Default: false
    -c, --charset
      Charset used for input/output
      Default: UTF-8
    -h, --help
      Print this help
    -m, --midpoint-home
      Path to MidPoint home folder. If relative path is specified, it will be translated to absolute path.
    -p, --password
      Password for JDBC connection
    -P, --password-ask
      Ninja will ask for JDBC connection password
    --psn-class-name
      PolyString normalizer class name
    --psn-lowercase
      PolyString normalizer lowercase
    --psn-nfkd
      PolyString normalizer NFKD. Unicode Normalization Form Compatibility Decomposition (NFKD). This process
      expands composed characters (e.g. diacritic marks, ligatures, roman numerals). Character components are
      then processed individually. E.g. ascii7 normalizer will then remove just the diacritic mark, but leave
      the base letter. Therefore, for a-acute character with NFKD processing the output will be plain "a"
      character. Without NFKD processing the whole character will be removed.
    --psn-trim
      PolyString normalizer trim. Removes whitespace from beginning and end of the string. Trimming is done
      before any other processing.
    --psn-trim-whitespace
      PolyString normalizer trim whitespace
    -s, --silent
      No output at all
      Default: false
    -U, --url
      JDBC URL to database. If '-m' option is used URL will be used to connect to JDBC database.
    -u, --username
      Username for JDBC connection
    -v, --verbose
      Verbose output
      Default: false

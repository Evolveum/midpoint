= Export Shadow Statistics

Export shadow statistics command allows users to export statistics about shadow objects.
In particular, it exports counts of shadow objects grouped by resource, object class, kind and intent.

**All exported statistics are intentionally approximations.**
Counts of objects are given in the form of scale as the maximum number in that particular scale "level".

.Count scale example

| Exact count | Approximate value

| 1
| 99

| 10
| 99

| 100
| 999

| 998
| 999

| 9999
|===

Statistics can be exported to `SYSOUT` or to file (`-o`, `--output`).
Use `-O`, `--overwrite` switch if you wish to overwrite an existing output file.

Note: this command is not supposed to run in multiple threads, therefore do not modify the default threading settings which is set to 1 by default (`--multi-thread`, `-l` options).

.Example: export statistics into output.xml file
[source,bash]
----
ninja.sh export-shadow-statistics --output output.xml

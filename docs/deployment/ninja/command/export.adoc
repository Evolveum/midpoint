= Export

Export command allows users to export objects.
Object can be exported to `SYSOUT` or to file (`-o`, `--output`) and compressed using ZIP if needed (`-z`, `--zip`).
Export also support multi-threading (`-l`, `--multi-thread`).
Use `-O`, `--overwrite` switch if you wish to overwrite an existing output file.
Objects exported from midPoint can be filtered in several ways:

* by oid (`--oid`)
* by type (`-t, --type`) and filter (`-f, --filter`)

[WARNING]
When exporting shadow objects from midPoint `-r (--raw)` option must be used to export data correctly.
Raw option will add schema for shadow attributes (to be used in import later on).
Behavior without raw option will export shadow attribute without schema because of backward compatibility.

.Example of export to compressed zip file using 4 threads:
[source,bash]
----
./bin/ninja.sh export -O export.zip -z -l 4

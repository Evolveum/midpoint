= Export

Export command allows users to export objects.
Object can be exported to `SYSOUT` or to file (`-o`, `--output`) and compressed using ZIP if needed (`-z`, `--zip`).
Export also support multi-threading (`-l`, `--multi-thread`).
Use `-O`, `--overwrite` switch if you wish to overwrite an existing output file.
Objects exported from midPoint can be filtered in several ways:

* by oid (`--oid`)
* by type (`-t, --type`) and filter (`-f, --filter`)

[WARNING]
====
When creating export from midPoint `-r (--raw)` option must be used to export data correctly.
It's mandatory mainly for shadow objects. Raw option will add schema for shadow attributes (to be used in import later on).

Without `--raw` option, ninja will export shadow attributes without schema because of backward compatibility.

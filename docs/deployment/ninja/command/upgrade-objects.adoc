= Upgrade objects

Command `upgrade-objects` can be used to _upgrade_ objects to get rid of deprecated or obsolete data and configuration.
This operation should be used with CSV output file from `verify` command.
For more information about verification, see xref:./verify.adoc[].

Verification report should be reviewed before running upgrade command.
It is important to understand what will be changed and how can it affect the system.

Only verification items with _type = seamless_ will be updated.
Scope of upgrade-objects command can be set in several ways:

* by oid (`--oid`)
* by type (`-t, --type`) and filter (`-f, --filter`)

This way it is possible to upgrade only specific objects.
Verification items can be skipped also using last column in CSV file.
Any of `true`, `t`, `yes`, `y` will tell ninja to skip the item.

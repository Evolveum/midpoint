= Export Resource Schema and Capabilities

Export schemas and capabilities of the resource.
This command is basically a "shortcut" to export resource schemas and capabilities without any other configurations as done with xref:export-configuration.adoc[export configuration command].
Please check and remove any sensitive information from the export output (e.g. it may contain metadata).

You can also explicitly exclude any item from the export (`-ei`, `--exclude-item`).
Statistics can be exported to `SYSOUT` or to file (`-o`, `--output`).
Use `-O`, `--overwrite` switch if you wish to overwrite an existing output file.

Note: this command is not supposed to run in multiple threads, therefore do not modify the default threading settings which is set to 1 by default (`--multi-thread`, `-l` options).

.Example: export resource schema and capabilities into output.xml file
[source,bash]
----
ninja.sh export-resource-schema --output output.xml

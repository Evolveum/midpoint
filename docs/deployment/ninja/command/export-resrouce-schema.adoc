= Export Resource Schema
:page-experimental: true

Export schemas of the resource.
This command is basically a "shortcut" to export just resource schemas without any other configurations as done with xref:export-configuration.adoc[export configuration command].

You can also explicitly exclude any item from the export (`-ei`, `--exclude-item`).
Statistics can be exported to `SYSOUT` or to file (`-o`, `--output`).
Use `-O`, `--overwrite` switch if you wish to overwrite an existing output file.

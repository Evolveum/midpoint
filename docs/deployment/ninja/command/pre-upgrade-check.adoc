= Pre-upgrade check

Pre-upgrade check is a simple check that verifies that current midPoint version matches version of distribution that is going to be upgraded.
There are two items being checked:

* database schema version
* midPoint cluster nodes version

== Database schema version check

This check verifies that database schema version matches supported version.
Database schema version is stored in `m_global_metadata` table and separate version is stored for midPoint repository and audit.
Schema version check can be skipped if necessary using option `--skip-database-version-check`.

== Nodes version check

This check verifies that all nodes in midPoint cluster have the same version and that version is eligible for upgrade.
Nodes version check can be skipped if necessary using option `--skip-nodes-version-check`.

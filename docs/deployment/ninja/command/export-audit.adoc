= Export audit

//TODO split into export and import

[NOTE]
Audit export/import uses the same format as objects, even utilizing `<objects>` element,
but audit records are *containers, not objects*.
These files are only useful for Ninja import/export, do not try to use them in Studio or otherwise.

.Example: audit export to a zipped file, overwriting any existing file, using an Axiom filter
[source,bash]
----
./bin/ninja.sh exportAudit -o audit-export.xml.zip -z -O -f '%timestamp < "2021-12-01"'
----

Now you can move the exported file to a new environment and run the import:

.Example: audit import
[source,bash]
----
./bin/ninja.sh importAudit -i audit-export.xml.zip -z
----

= Import

Import command allow users to import objects to midPoint.
Objects can be read from `SYSOUT` or file (`-i`, `--input`) and uncompressed using ZIP if needed (`-z`, `--zip`).

Import also support multi-threading (`-l`, `--multi-thread`).
For more information about multi-threading see xref:/midpoint/reference/deployment/ninja#how-multithreading-works[here].

Use `-O`, `--overwrite` switch if you wish to overwrite existing objects in midPoint.

Object read from input (file or sysout) can be filtered in several ways:

* by oid (`--oid`)
* by type (`-t, --type`) and filter (`-f, --filter`)

= Verify

Verification is a process that reads objects from midPoint repository and checks whether they are compatible with new version of midPoint.
Verification checks for deprecated, removed elements or other issues that can cause problems during or after upgrade.

Different categories for verification can be set turned on via switch `--verification-category`.
Allowed values are  `DEPRECATED`, `REMOVED`, `PLANNED_REMOVAL`, `INCORRECT_OIDS`, `MULTI_VALUE_REF_WITHOUT_OID`, `MISSING_NATURAL_KEY`, `MULTIVALUE_BYTE_ARRAY`, `PROTECTED_DATA_NOT_EXTERNAL`.
By default, all categories are checked.

By default, ninja displays warnings about objects to `SYSOUT`.
Output can be redirected to file using `-o`, `--output`.

Verifications supports multi-threading (`-l`, `--multi-thread`).
For more information about multi-threading see xref:/midpoint/reference/deployment/ninja#how-multithreading-works[here].

Verification can run while midPoint is running.
The whole verification can be split into multiple parts, each part verifying a subset of similar objects using `-f, --filter` and `-t, --type` options.
This way verification reports can be simpler to read and easier to understand, since they should contain smaller set of issues.

Verification results can be reported in two styles plain and CSV.
The switch for report style is `--report-style [plain|csv]`.
Plain style is set as default option, while CSV is better for further processing and review.
CSV report style creates two files - CSV and XML.
XML will contain list of deltas for each object, describing what ninja wants to change on object to _upgrade_ it.

The CSV report contain three sets of columns:

* Object identification (oid, name, type)
* Verification item information (status, path, message)
* Upgrade information (multiple columns see <<Upgrade information>>)

== Upgrade information

Upgrade information consists of following columns:

* *Identifier* - unique identifier of verification/upgrade item which can be used to group similar items together when processing reports.
* *Phase* - upgrade phase in which item should be updated (before or after midPoint is upgraded).
* *Priority*
** *Critical* - midPoint may fail to start or work properly if such verification item is not fixed (updated).
Critical item would also halt upgrade procedure in next phase, unless this check is explicitly skipped using `--skip-verification` option.
** *Necessary* - verification item should be fixed, midPoint should not fail to start, but some features might not work properly.
** *Optional* - this item doesn't have to be necessarily fixed, but it's recommended to do so.
E.g. deprecated configuration which might be removed in version after next one.
* *Type*
** *Seamless* - such item can be handled by ninja automatically without any user interaction.
E.g. there's clear migration path without any change in functionality.
** *Preview* - ninja can provide new configuration for such item, but it's recommended to review it before applying.
** *Manual* - ninja can't provide any configuration for such item, user has to fix it manually.
Reason can be that there's currently no migration path (removed feature) or there are multiple possible solutions that doesn't map configuration 1:1.
* *Description* - contains more information, mainly on how to upgrade/update such item.
* *Skip* - last column in CSV report, can be used to mark items that should be skipped during object upgrade.

Such CSV report has to be used as input for upgrade objects command with option `--verification-file`.
See xref:./upgrade-objects.adoc[] for more information.

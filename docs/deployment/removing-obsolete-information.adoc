During midPoint operation, some data items gradually gather in the repository.
Typical examples are tasks and audit records.

== Cleanup policy

MidPoint provides a feature that automatically cleans-up the repository with respect to these items.
A system task named *Cleanup* runs (by default) every 24 hours and removes tasks and audit records older than predefined time value.
This is the default configuration from the xref:/midpoint/reference/concepts/system-configuration-object/[System Configuration object]:

[source,xml]
----
<c:cleanupPolicy xmlns:c="http://midpoint.evolveum.com/xml/ns/public/common/common-2a">
	<c:auditRecords>
		<c:maxAge>P3M</c:maxAge>
	</c:auditRecords>
	<c:closedTasks>
		<c:maxAge>P1M</c:maxAge>
	</c:closedTasks>
</c:cleanupPolicy>
----

This configuration causes the Cleanup task to remove all audit records older than three months
(see link:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601[the ISO 8601 specification]) and all closed tasks that are more than one month after their completion.

Note: More precisely, when removing the tasks, only root tasks are considered.
When a root task is removed, all of its subtasks (that should be completed before the root) are removed as well.

== Cleanup elements

Element type for `cleanupPolicy` is documented in our https://evolveum.com/downloads/midpoint/4.4/midpoint-4.4-schemadoc/http---midpoint-evolveum-com-xml-ns-public-common-common-3/type/CleanupPoliciesType.html[schemadoc].
There are more `CleanupPolicyType` elements available in `cleanupPolicy`, not configured by default in the System Configuration object:

* `auditRecords` to clean up audit records,
* `closedTasks` to clean up closed tasks,
* `closedCases` to clean up closed cases,
* `closedCertificationCampaigns` to clean up closed certification campaigns,
* `outputReports` to clean up output reports,
* and `deadNodes` to clean up dead nodes.

The things mentioned above are cleaned up regularly by the *Cleanup* task.

There are other clean-up settings, but these are consulted only when the relevant structures are worked with:

* `objectResults` clean-up policy for object execution results - used as a default when the following settings are not specified,
* `simpleOperationExecutions` is used to clean up simple execution results,
* `complexOperationExecutions` is used to clean up complex execution results.

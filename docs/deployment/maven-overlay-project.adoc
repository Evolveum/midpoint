== Introduction

There are many ways how to customize midPoint behavior.
MidPoint is designed with practicality in mind and therefore the most frequent customizations can be done by configuration.
But it is not possible to make everything configurable.
Some customizations require extension or even modification of midPoint code.

This page describes how to set up and maintain an _overlay project_ that contains midPoint customizations.

== How Overlay Works?

[IMPORTANT]
====
MidPoint packaging was migrated from WAR to JAR in 4.6.

Previously it was based on link:https://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-war-plugin/overlays.html[Maven WAR Overlay]
mechanism combined with link:https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/maven-plugin/repackage-mojo.html[Spring Boot repackaging].
Overlay project took the `admin-gui` "Spring-bootified" WAR module (renamed as `midpoint.war`),
opened it, placed some stuff over it, packaged it as WAR and repackaged it with Spring Boot again.

With JAR packaging, only the Spring Boot repackaging is used.

The following text only covers the JAR overlay mechanism now.
====

Overlay projects creates a new midPoint binary distribution (`midpoint.jar`) with your customizations added to it.
The customizations may be configuration files, web resources (HTML, CSS, images) and even Java code.
The overlay can also override stock midPoint files and classes and replace them with custom versions.

The overlay project contains only the customized files.
There is no need to copy stock midPoint sources and even binaries.
The Maven will download everything that it needs directly from Evolveum repositories.
As the overlay project only contains customizations it can easily be maintained in a version control system.

The overlay project effectively does the same stuff the internal https://github.com/Evolveum/midpoint/tree/master/gui/midpoint-jar[midpoint-jar] module does.
It takes `admin-gui` and all the other midpoint modules and packages them as Spring Boot JAR.
The new JAR "overlay" contains only your stuff directly in the JAR (inside its `BOOT-INF/classes` directory).
Everything else is under `WEB-INF/lib` only as JAR dependencies.

[NOTE]
====
There is *one* thing you have to take care of that the `midpoint-jar` module does - it provides `banner.txt`.
This is the ASCII art at the start of the log.
If you don't need it, it's OK, you don't have to do anything.
If you want it, either copy it from https://github.com/Evolveum/midpoint/tree/master/gui/midpoint-jar/src/main/resources[here]
or create your own.
Name it `banner.txt` and place it under `src/main/resources` of your overlay project.

There you go, banner resurrected!

== Example Overlay Projects

Following overlay examples are maintained by midPoint team for demonstration and documentation purposes:

* Basic link:https://github.com/Evolveum/midpoint-overlay-example[Evolveum/midpoint-overlay-example] - this one serves two purposes:

** It provides simple GUI customization example, see link:https://github.com/Evolveum/midpoint-overlay-example/blob/master/README.adoc[README] for its description.

** It documents link:https://github.com/Evolveum/midpoint-overlay-example/blob/master/doc/overlay-development.adoc[midPoint overlay development] in general, including points like schema extension and custom initial objects.



* link:https://github.com/Evolveum/midpoint-custom-soap-service-wsdl[Evolveum/midpoint-custom-soap-service-wsdl] with CXF-based SOAP web-service.
This demonstrates overlay as a part of Maven multi-module project.
link:https://github.com/Evolveum/midpoint-custom-service/blob/master/README.adoc[README] provides quick hints about using CXF for SOAP web-services on topics like WSDL vs code-first, WS-Security and how to use midPoint authorizations.

* link:https://github.com/Evolveum/midpoint-custom-soap-service[Evolveum/midpoint-custom-soap-service] is simplified SOAP web-service using code-first approach using basic authentication from midPoint.

* Finally, there is link:https://github.com/Evolveum/midpoint-custom-rest-service[Evolveum/midpoint-custom-rest-service] showing REST service also implemented with CXF, but from version 4.2 also experimental (but much simpler) Spring MVC endpoint.

== Overlay development

Development document is now part of the link:https://github.com/Evolveum/midpoint-overlay-example[basic overlay example] - see link:https://github.com/Evolveum/midpoint-overlay-example/blob/master/doc/overlay-development.adoc[midPoint overlay development]. It describes how to build and run the project (including IDE), how to develop against fresh snapshots, how the xref:/midpoint/reference/deployment/midpoint-home-directory/[MidPoint Home Directory] customizations and initial-objects customizations work.

The document also includes link:https://github.com/Evolveum/midpoint-overlay-example/blob/master/doc/overlay-development.adoc#overlay-upgrade-notes[overlay upgrade notes] (starting with upgrade to midPoint 4.1).

Notifications are used to send information about events that occur within midPoint.
They can be related to (e.g.)

. model: like adding, modifying or deleting a user,

. resource objects: like adding, modifying or deleting an account,

. workflows: like starting or completing work item or process,

. certifications: like opening or closing a campaign,

. tasks: e.g. when a task is starting or finishing.

Besides these, midPoint has a special kind of event: *custom events*.
These can be used to send "any other" notifications, not covered by the above types.

A custom event has the following attributes:

[%autowidth]
|===
| Attribute | Meaning

| subtype
| Free-text information about category (type) of this custom event.
For example, "passwordResetRequest" (if used for self-service functionality).

| operation
| Add / modify / delete - if relevant for a given type of custom events.

| status
| Success / alsoSuccess / failure / onlyFailure / inProgress - if relevant for a given type of custom events.

| object
| Object to which is given event related.
It can be a PrismObject or any other object (Item, PrismValue, plain Java object, or even a collection of objects).

| adHocHandler
| Event handler that should be used to process this event.

|===

These custom events can be processed in one or both of the following ways:

. Using standard notification configuration in system configuration object.
I.e. they might be filtered and eventually translated into messages using a notifier.
Because no out-of-the-box notifier exists for custom events, a generalNotifier has to be used.
This notifier has to specify the recipient(s), subject, and body of created message.

. Using ad-hoc event handler, specified within the event itself.
Definition of this handler is exactly the same as definition of handlers in system configuration.

When a custom event is processed, first the ad-hoc handler is used (if present), followed by handler(s) from the system configuration object.

== How to submit custom events

=== Using bulk actions

In order to easily send custom events there is the *notify* scripting (bulk) action.
It takes the input from the pipe - usually a list of PrismObjects - and creates an event for each one of them.
(Alternatively, for the whole list, if forWholeInput parameter is set to "true".)

The following parameters are available:

[%autowidth]
|===
| Parameter | Meaning

| subtype
| Subtype of the event created.

| operation
| Operation to be put into event (add, modify, delete).
Default is "add".

| status
| Status to be put into event (success, failure, inProgress, alsoSuccess, onlyFailure).
Default is "success".

| handler
| Ad-hoc event handler that should be used to process the event.

| forWholeInput
| Whole input (i.e. all items in the pipeline) should be sent as event object.
The default behavior is to generate one event for each input object.

|===

All of them are optional.

== Using Java code

Constructing and submitting custom events is simple; like this:

[source,java]
----
Event event = new CustomEvent(
        lightweightIdentifierGenerator, subtype, handler, item, operation, status, channel);
notificationManager.processEvent(event, task, result);
----

Just have a look at link:https://github.com/Evolveum/midpoint/blob/master/model/model-impl/src/main/java/com/evolveum/midpoint/model/impl/scripting/actions/NotifyExecutor.java[NotifyExecutor Java class] (implementing "notify" bulk action).

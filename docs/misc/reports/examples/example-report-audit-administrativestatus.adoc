Please see xref:/midpoint/reference/admin-gui/dashboards/configuration/[Dashboard configuration] for basic information about configuration variables and Auditing-Custom column for steps how to add custom column.

== Example Use-case

Administrator needs display all audit events which contains delta with changes on administrativeStatus of account on resource R1

== Configuration

As first, we need add custom column to m_audit_event table, on it use next sql commands:

.*Adding new custom column*
[source,sql]
----
ALTER TABLE ma_audit_event ADD custSituation VARCHAR(255);

CREATE INDEX iAuditEventCustSituation
    ON ma_audit_event (custSituation);
----

.*Example Resource Configuration*

sampleRef::samples/resources/csv/resource-csv-username.xml[]
====

.*Example CSV Source File*
[%collapsible]
====
sampleRef::samples/resources/csv/midpoint-username.csv[]
====

As next adding we're adding next snippet of configuration to config.xml file in Midpoint home directory.

.*config.xml configuration snippet*
[%collapsible]
====
sampleRef::samples/misc/config-custom-column.xml[]
====

After modifying config.xml we have to restart Midpoint. As last part of adding custom column adding next configuration to system configuration.

.*Snippet of system configuration*
[%collapsible]
====
sampleRef::samples/misc/system-config-event-rec.xml[]
====

 I chose situations are split by '|', but you can use more columns. Now, we need configure object collection for audit records.
In object collection for audit events we use sql select command.

.*Object collection*
[%collapsible]
====
sampleRef::samples/objectCollection/admin-status-midification.xml[]
====

When we have object collection, then import Dashboard object with widget for our object collection.

.*Dashboard*
[%collapsible]
====
sampleRef::samples/dashboard/change-of-admin-status-custom-column.xml[]
====

After successful import of dashboard object and reload of page you can see dashboard in menu *Dashboards* > *Changes of administrativeStatus(R1)*.

We want report with table of audit events, so we import dashboard report.

.*Report*
[%collapsible]
====
sampleRef::samples/reports/dashboard-report-custom-column.xml[]
====

Now we can run report in report menu, show task, and download report.
Every report from dashboard is in HTML format.

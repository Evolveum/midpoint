== Example Use-case

Administrator needs to display all roles with the number of their members.

== Configuration

As the first step we need to configure an object collection for all roles.

//TODO check after sampleRef is fully in prod
.*Example Object Collection*

sampleRef::samples/objectCollection/all-roles.xml[]
====

We want a report with table of roles for this we configure the report definition.

//TODO check after sampleRef is fully in prod
.*Example Report Configuration*
[%collapsible]
====
link:https://github.com/Evolveum/midpoint-samples/blob/master/samples/reports/roles-and-members.xml[Git]

sampleRef::samples/reports/roles-and-members.xml[]
====

Now we can run the report in the report menu, and download the report.

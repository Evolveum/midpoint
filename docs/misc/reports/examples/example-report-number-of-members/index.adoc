== Example Use-case

Administrator needs to display all roles with the number of their members.

== Configuration

As the first step we need to configure an object collection for all roles.

.*Example Object Collection*
[%collapsible]
====
sampleRef::samples/objectCollection/all-roles.xml[]
====

We want a report with table of roles for this we configure the report definition.

.*Example Report Configuration*
[%collapsible]
====
sampleRef::samples/reports/roles-and-members.xml[]
====

Now we can run the report in the report menu, and download the report.

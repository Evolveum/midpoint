== Introduction

The following page contains some examples on how to configure the post report script feature, in other words how to configure the execution of a specified command-line script after a report is generated.

=== Parameters

The scripts can be parameterized using inputs from the report itself. The script is executed like this:

. The expressions defined for parameters defined in the command-line scrips are evaluated.
Currently only macro parameters are supported.

. The macros denoted as %name% in the script command-line are expanded using the expressions results.

. Command is executed.

The expressions take following variables as input:

[%autowidth]
|===
| Name | Description

| object
| Entire report object (ReportType)


| task
| Task that have executed the report. +
Note: report parameters are stored in the task, as is the user that started the report.


| file
| Filename where the generated report is stored


|===


=== Execution Mode

There are two execution modes:

* exec: This mode will execute the command-line using native operating system service.
On UNIX systems this is the exec() operation.
The command-line string needs to be divided to the command and the parameters, which may not work well in all cases.

* shell: The command will be executed by using the shell.
The shell is executed first and the command is passed to the shell (e.g. bash -c command).
This works only on UNIX systems, and it currently defaults to bash shell.


=== Examples

Following script copies the report to the /tmp directory:

[source,xml]
----
<report>
    ...
    <postReportScript>
        <macro> <!--1-->
            <name>file</name> <!--2-->
            <asIs/>
        </macro>
        <macro><!--3-->
            <name>name</name>
            <script>
                <code>
                    object.getName().getOrig()
                </code>
            </script>
        </macro>
        <executionMethod>shell</executionMethod>
        <code>cp %file% /tmp/%name%.pdf</code> <!--4--><!--5-->
    </postReportScript>
</report>
----

<1> The file macro.
<2> Value of expression variable `file`.
<3> When this macro is applied to a command-line then the `%file%` string will be replaced by the name of the file that contains report output.

<4> This is the `name` macro.
It takes name of the report from the report object (ReportType).
<5> The string `%name%` in the command-line will be replaced by the result of the macro expression, which is a name of the report.

=== Error reporting

The information about errors which could occur during script execution will be present in the result section of the task created for generating the script.
If any such message is returned by the process error stream than it will be recorded in this section.
The amount of information on a particular error can differ with the used environment.
For additional debugging the following logger can be used.

[%autowidth]
|===
| Logger name | Log level

| com.evolveum.midpoint.repo.common.commandline
| TRACE

[TIP]
====
The report will be generated even if there is an error during the execution of the post report script.

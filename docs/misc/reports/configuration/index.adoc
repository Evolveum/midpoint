MidPoint reports can be configured based on the following midPoint concepts:

- xref:/midpoint/reference/misc/reports/configuration/dashboard-report.adoc[Dashboards]
- xref:/midpoint/reference/misc/reports/configuration/collection-report.adoc[Object Collections]

Current implementation supports exporting reports to the formats mentioned in the following xref:/midpoint/reference/misc/reports/report-formats.adoc[article].

== How to Configure Reports

Every report object consists of the configuration of three basic parts:

* `behavior` - represents the direction of the report.
There are two possible types of `behavior`: _export_ and _import_.
+
_Export_ behavior represents the basic reporting mechanism, where the file with reported objects is generated.
+
_Import_ behavior can be used in situations, when the objects need to be imported midPoint from an external file.
The supported format is CSV.
Import behavior is experimental.
* `engine` - defines the report generation base.
There are two supported options, reports based on object collections and reports based on a dashboard.
Only one can be defined at the same time.
* `fileFormat` - represents format of the generated report file.
Supported formats for now are CSV and HTML.
Default format for the dashboard-based reports is HTML and for object collection based reports is CSV.

|===
| Name | Type | Description


| _fileFormat_
| *FileFormatConfigurationType*
| Define report output file format.


| _dashboard_
| *DashboardReportEngineConfigurationType*
| Configuration for dashboard-based reports.
When defined, dashboard engine is used to generate reports.


| _objectCollection_
| *ObjectCollectionReportEngineConfigurationType*
| Configuration for object collection-based reports.
When defined, object collection engine is used to generate report.


| _defaultScriptConfiguration_
| *ScriptExpressionEvaluatorConfigurationType*
| Default configuration for the scripts executed inside the report.


| _postReportScript_
| *CommandLineScriptType*
| Command-line script that will be executed after the report is complete and the output file is completely produced.
Output filename will be passed to the script as the "file" argument.

== Export Behaviour

include::../raw/file-format.adoc[]

== Report Engine

Report engine defines the source of data which is used in the report definition, either you use `objectCollection` or `dashboard` elements in report.

In the case you want to use *Object Collections*, have a look at xref:../configuration/collection-report.adoc[this] article dedicated to the related configuration.

In case of *Dashboards* checkout out xref:../configuration/dashboard-report.adoc[this] configuration article.

== Report Creation

You have multiple possibilities how to create a report.
One is using the classical flow for creating a new object.
In this case look for the Report menu item on left side of screen in the main vertical menu, and select *new Report*.
Here you have two types of reports to choose from, the "Dashboard" reports and "Collection" reports.


Alternatively you can click on the 'Create report' button under, most of the tables on object list pages (e.g. All users page).
In this case, midPoint will automatically use the list as an implicit collection in the report.

After clicking the 'Create report' button, you will be redirected to the "new Report' page with predefined filters, based on the search panels from the object table.
Also, the columns from the previous table will be used as columns for the new report.
You can either use the generated values or you can customise the report definition further.

Another possibility is the usage of one of the report definitions present in each midPoint distribution out of the box.
These are pre-configured reports based on often used use-cases.
Naturally you can use them as a basis for your custom reports.

You can create and configure reports also with the use of the xref:/midpoint/reference/interfaces/rest/endpoints/reports.adoc[REST API].

Examples on how to create a report can be found in our xref:/midpoint/reference/misc/reports/create-report-guide/[*Create a Report Guide*]

For additional configuration details chose from the following articles based on the type of report:

- xref:/midpoint/reference/misc/reports/configuration/collection-report.adoc[Collection Based Reports]
- xref:/midpoint/reference/misc/reports/configuration/dashboard-report.adoc[Dashboard Based Reports]

== How to Generate The Report

The actual report (i.e. report file) has to be generated.
This is done usually by clicking the "run" ("Save and run" or "Run original report") button from the report definition.
This will execute a special task object which generated the actual report.
After the "run" button is clicked you can access the task either directly through the "notification" prompt which will appear at the header of the page ("show task" button).
Or you can access the report through the left vertical menu "Server tasks" > "Report tasks" button and find your task amongst the list of tasks.

The actual report file can be downloaded when the task successfully finished, for this the task GUI contains the "Download report" button.

There are multiple ways how tasks are build when executed from a report definition, for more information on this and also information how you can distribute the workload of the task to multiple nodes see xref:../configuration/report-task-definition.adoc[this] page

== Import Behaviour 'Import From Report'

As mentioned above, the report functionality is also capable of using exported reports or custom csv files to create or update objects.
We call this "Import" or "Reverse" reports, for more information regarding them please see the following page:

xref:../configuration/report-task-definition.adoc[Import From Report]

== Reports With Large Datasets

The way how a report is generated by default might need to be customized in case you are working with a large set of data.
For this you need to specify the resources which midPoint can allocate for such process.
For some more details please have a look at this xref:/midpoint/reference/misc/reports/configuration/report-task-definition#_multithreading_and_bucketing[article].

== Report Security

Reports quite often use midPoint expressions, which in some cases might cause security concerns if not used with caution.
Please have a look at xref:../configuration/report-security.adoc[this] page for a more detailed description.

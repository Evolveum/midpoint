== Description

In addition to the common xref:/midpoint/reference/expressions/expressions/script/functions/[script expression libraries]
(`midpoint`, `basic` and `log`), you can also use the `report` library inside report expressions.

Functions from the `report` library are tailored for report creation, making it more convenient.

It contains functions like:

* resolving functions - references to objects, assignment to their target objects, etc.,
* support for reports related to certification campaigns and cases,
* functions for audit searching,
* functions for simulation reports,
* and more...

For the complete list of functions check the
https://github.com/Evolveum/midpoint/blob/master/model/report-impl/src/main/java/com/evolveum/midpoint/report/impl/ReportFunctions.java[source code]
(see the table below for links to concrete versions).

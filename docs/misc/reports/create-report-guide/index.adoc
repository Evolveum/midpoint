== Create A Basic Report

There is a quick and easy way how to generate a report form an object list.
This is an example how you can do it.

Let's visit a list of users:

* go to *"Users >All Users"*
* scroll to the *bottom of the screen*
* click *"Create report"* (‘pie chart’ button)

The screen represents a *“new” Collection report*. There are a couple of parameters we have to *input*
here

* type in the Name: *"All users report"*
* click *"Save and run"*

After success the top screen should have a “blue” banner stating that there is a task on the
background.

* click *show task* on it

* in the action button container on the top of the page click on the button *"Download report"*
* you should have a csv with *all the users in midPoint.*

== Execute an Already Existing Report

If we already have a *Report Definition present*, either one which was created by us or one pre-configure out of the box, we just need to find it among the *list of reports*.

* in *"Reports >All reports"* (or choose one of the report types)

image::reports-all.png[75%]

* Click on *"Users in MidPoint"*
* In the reports page Click *"Run original report"*

image::users-in-mp.png[75%]

* Because the report has configurable *parameters* a window called "Report configuration before run" will pop up, click on *"Run Report"*

image::conf-b-run.png[75%]

* A blue banner will show up, click the *"show task"* string which is on it

image::run-usrs-in-mp.png[75%]

* in the action button container on the top of the page click on the button *"Download report"*

== Intermediate Report Customization

If you want an *example with more customization* regarding the report columns and the output format, please see the xref:/midpoint/reference/misc/reports/create-report-guide/intermediate[intermediate use-case]

== Advanced Reporting Use-Case

In this next topic we look at an advanced reporting set-up.
In the following article we have described a *custom report* created via the GUI where we fine tune the reported collection and use some *advanced configuration parameters*:
Some customization via scripting is involved as well.

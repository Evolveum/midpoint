== Create A Basic Report

There is a quick and easy way how to generate a report form an object list.
This is an example how you can do it.

Let's visit a list of users:

* go to *Users >All Users*
* scroll to the *bottom of the screen*
* click *Create report* (‘pie chart’ button)

The screen represents a *“new” Collection report*. There are a couple of parameters we have to *input*
here

* type in the Name: *All users report*
* click *Save and run*

After success the top screen should have a “blue” banner stating that there is a task on the
background.

* click *show task* on it

* in the action button container on the top of the page click on the button *Download report*
* you should have a csv with *all the users in midPoint.*

== Advanced Reporting Use-Case

In this next topic we look at an advanced reporting set-up.
In the following article we have described a *custom report* created via the GUI where we fine tune the reported collection and use some *advanced configuration parameters*:
Some customization via scripting is involved as well.

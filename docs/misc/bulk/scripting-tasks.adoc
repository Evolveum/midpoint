There are two ways of executing scripts within tasks:

. _traditional one_, where the whole script is put into the task;

. _iterative one_, where the search for objects is executed by generic iterative task handler and the script contains only the actions that are to be executed on objects found.

Iterative execution is available since midPoint 3.8. Its main advantage is that it is segmentable, so the task can be distributed onto multiple nodes as well as suspended + resumed at the (approximate) point of suspension.

Iterative execution has also some performance (memory consumption) advantages when large number of objects are processed.
Therefore, for considerable number of objects (e.g. thousands) the traditional tasks are considered to be [.underline]#deprecated#.


== Traditional scripting tasks

This is a traditional approach: the whole script is present in the `nonIterativeScripting` property.
The script consists of `search` instruction, followed by the `modify` action.

This approach is more general than the following one: the script can be of any form, not necessarily `search` + something.
However, the work cannot be segmented into buckets, and therefore cannot be distributed nor resumed after suspension.


== Iterative scripting tasks


=== An example (single-node)

.*Iterative bulk action that sets preferredLanguage for all users*

Now the `scriptExecutionRequest` contains only the action(s) to be executed on objects found.
The objects to be processed are specified using `objects` and (optionally) `query` properties.

Although this approach is more limited (it is always a search followed by some processing), it can be easily segmented and thus distributed and resumed after suspension.

An example of distribution on cluster nodes is shown below:


=== An example (multi-node)

.Iterative bulk action that sets preferredLanguage for all users (multi-node)

Here the work to be done is segmented into 16^3^ = 4096 buckets that are processed by two worker tasks on each node.
(This number of buckets is appropriate for - let's say - 40.000-400.000 users, having 100-1000 users in one bucket.)

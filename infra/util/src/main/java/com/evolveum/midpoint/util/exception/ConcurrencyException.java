/**
 * Exceptional concurrency state or operation invocation.
 *
 * This exception is thrown in case of race conditions and similar conflicting concurrency conditions.
 * It is also thrown in an attempt to acquire already acquired locks and similar cases.
 *
 * This condition is implemented as exception in a hope that it will help avoid silently ignoring the
 * concurrency problems and that the developers will be forced to handle the condition.
 * It is much easier to ignore a return value than to ignore an exception.

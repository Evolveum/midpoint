    <xsd:annotation>
        <xsd:documentation>
            This is supposed to be "standard" resource schema. Good resource
            connectors/adapter/whatever will (hopefully) follow it and define
            sub-types based on abstract supertypes in this schema. Some examples
            of this are provided at the end of the document.
            
            This schema is considered dynamic. It means that the concrete schema
            of a specific resource will be only available in run-time. As this
            schema will not be available in build-time, JAX-B and similar tools
            cannot be used on it. Therefore the components that need to
            understand it must parse it in run-time and dynamically interpret
            it.

            The schema is using custom annotations to express facets of the
            resource schema that XSD does not support, such as readability/
            writability of attribute, reference target types, etc.

            Recommended namespace prefix: r

    <xsd:element name="identifier" type="tns:AttributeReferenceType">
        <xsd:annotation>
            <xsd:documentation>
                Specifies which resource attribute (property) is identifier of
                a specific resource object type.

                This annotation points to the element in schema that is supposed
                to be primary identifier for the object class. There may be
                multiple annotations using this element. In that case the unique
                identifier is an compound identifier (the combination of all
                such elements is an unique identifier).

                This is supposed to be an annotation of an object class
                (complexType in resource schema).

    <xsd:element name="secondaryIdentifier" type="tns:AttributeReferenceType">
        <xsd:annotation>
            <xsd:documentation>
                Specifies which resource attribute is secondary identifier of
                a specific resource object class. Secondary identifier must be
                unique, but may not be persistent.

                Secondary identifier is used as a supplement to primary
                identifier. E.g. if primary identifier is an immutable UUID,
                which is in itself sufficient to uniquely identify an entry,
                but may not be efficient to use. DN may be more efficient in
                this case, and therefore may be designed as secondary
                identifier. Primary identifier, being immutable, may still be
                used to efficiently detect renames.

                This is supposed to be an annotation of an object class

                        compositeIdentifier must be specified but the
                        identifier always overrides the compositeIdentifier.

                point to an attribute of xsd:string type. If not present,
                primary identifier will be used instead.

                Specifies which resource attribute should be used as a "technical" name
                for the account. This name will appear in log files and other troubleshooting
                tools. The name should be a form of unique identifier that can be used to
                locate the resource object for diagnostics. It should not contain white chars and
                special chars if that can be avoided and it should be reasonable short.
                
                It is different from a display name attribute. Display name is intended for a 
                common user or non-technical administrator (such as role administrator). The
                naming attribute is intended for technical IDM administrators and developers.

                It must point to an attribute of xsd:string type. If not

                Specifies a native name of the attribute, the name as it is used
                on the resource or as seen by the connector. It is used for
                diagnostics purposes and may be used by the connector itself.
                As the attribute names in XSD have to comply with XML element
                name limitations, this may be the only way how to determine
                original attribute name.

                The name should be the same as the one used by the resource, if
                the resource supports naming of attributes. E.g. in case of LDAP
                this annotation should contain "cn", "givenName", etc. If the
                resource is not that flexible, the native attribute names may be
                hardcoded (e.g. "username", "homeDirectory") or may not be
                present at all.

                If not present, the it defaults to the corresponding element
                name (without namespace).

                        type of reference target objects.


                        It is used as an annnotation for attribute types that
                        point to resource objects, such as group members lists,
                        role lists, etc. The clients can use this annotation to
                        detect that the attribute points to a different object
                        and follow the reference or display it appropriatelly.

                        This mechanism is supposed to be used as a temporary
                        solution until a concept of "entitlements" is fully
                        developed. After that it should remain in existence as
                        a mechanism for older connectors and for a special
                        purpose attribute references.

                Specifies a native name of the object class, the name as it is
                used on the resource or as seen by the connector. It is used for
                diagnostics purposes and may be used by the connector itself.

                The name should be the same as the one used by the resource, if
                the resource supports naming of object classes. E.g. in case of
                LDAP this annotation should contain "inetOrgPerson",
                "groupOfNames", etc. If the resource is not that flexible,
                the native object class names may be hardcoded (e.g. "account",
                "group") or may not be present at all (which is discouraged).

                This annotation may appear several times if the object is
                composed from several native object classes (e.g. as usual in
                LDAP).

                If not present, the it defaults to the name of the object class
                XSD type (without namespace).

                the GUI. It should explain the meaning of an attribute or
                object class.

                    The set of unstructured flags. It is a temporary solution
                    for provisioning code to mark certain properties of
                    attributes that are considered experimental or under
                    development.  Any properties that are considered final for
                    a particular release should have its own annotation with an
                    appropriate documentation.

                    This is supposed to be an annotation of an attribute
                    (element in resource schema).

            MidPoint annotations intended for resource schemas.

            These annotation are supposed to be used in the resource schema. They should be places as
            annotation to the complexType definitions of resource schema. They extend the expression
            capabilities of prism annotation to further specify that details regarding resource
            objects, details that are out of the scope of prism objects.

                Resource object marker. The complex type marked by this annotation is considered to be
                a resource object.

                Every object in the resource schema should have this marker annotation. Complex type
                definition that do not have this annotation are not considered part of the resource schema
                unless they are referred from types that have this annotation.

                A flag that specifies whether this object class is a default for its type of object classes. E.g.
                when combined with "account" annotation it marks a default account type.

        <xsd:annotation>
            <xsd:documentation>
                Account type specification. The annotation contains a simple string value that is used to define
                account type, e.g. "user" or "admin".

    <xsd:element name="nativeObjectClass" type="xsd:string">
        <xsd:annotation>
            <xsd:documentation>
                Native object class name. This annotation contains string value that specifies native object class
                of the resource object without any transformations, the name as it is used on the resource or as
                seen by the connector.

                This annotation is used to specify the native object class only for diagnostics purposes and may be
                used by the connector itself. As the object class names in XSD have to comply with XSD limitations
                and by midPoint convention should end with ObjectClass suffix, this may be the only way how to determine
                original object class name. It is "read-only" in this aspect. It cannot use used to change or enforce
                object class mapping.

                The name should be the same as the one used by the resource, if the resource supports naming of object
                classes. E.g. in case of LDAP this annotation should contain "inetOrgPerson", "groupOfNames", etc. If
                the resource is not that flexible, the native object class names may be hardcoded (e.g. "account", "group")
                or may not be present at all (which is discouraged).

                This annotation may appear several times if the object is composed from several native object classes
                (e.g. as usual in LDAP).

                If not present, the it defaults to the name of the object class XSD type (without namespace).

    <xsd:element name="nativeAttributeName" type="xsd:string">
        <xsd:annotation>
            <xsd:documentation>
                Native attribute name. This annotation contains string value that specifies native name of the attribute
                without any transformations, the name as it is used on the resource or as seen by the connector.

                This annotation is used to specify the native attribute name only for diagnostics purposes and may be
                used by the connector itself. As the attribute names in XSD have to comply with XML element name limitations,
                this may be the only way how to determine original attribute name. It is "read-only" in this aspect. It
                cannot use used to change or enforce attribute name mapping.

                The name should be the same as the one used by the resource, if the resource supports naming of attributes.
                E.g. in case of LDAP this annotation should contain "cn", "givenName", etc. If the resource is not that flexible,
                the native attribute names may be hardcoded (e.g. "username", "homeDirectory") or may not be present at all.

                If not present, the it defaults to the corresponding element name (without namespace).

    <xsd:element name="frameworkAttributeName" type="xsd:string">
        <xsd:annotation>
            <xsd:documentation>
                Name of the attribute as given in the connector framework.
                This is not used for any significant logic. It is mostly for diagnostics.

    <xsd:element name="identifier" type="xsd:QName">
        <xsd:annotation>
            <xsd:documentation>
                Reference to the (primary) identifier attribute. This annotation contains a QName of the attribute that must
                be used to identify the resource objects. Identifiers are used to locate the object and to work with
                it. Every resource object must have at least one identifier to be practical.

                The value of identifier must by unique in the scope of the resource.

                The identifier should be immutable. E.g. if the object is renamed the identifier should be unchanged.

                There may be multiple identifiers for a single object type. In that case it is assumed that all such
                identifier attributes form a compound identifier. E.g. that each unique combination of identifier values
                refers to a different object.

                E.g. LDAP entryUUID, Unix UID, persistent object identifiers and similar attributes make a good identifier.
                Usernames, DNs and similar attributes may be used as well. But these are less desirable as they may change.
                Therefore these should be used only if no other option is available.

    </xsd:element>

    <xsd:element name="secondaryIdentifier" type="xsd:QName">
        <xsd:annotation>
            <xsd:documentation>
                Reference to the secondary identifier attribute. This annotation contains a QName of the attribute that may
                be used to provide additional identification to the resource objects. Secondary identifiers are used
                as an alternative way to locate the object.

                The value of secondary identifier must by unique in the scope of the resource.

                It is OK for a secondary identifier to be mutable.

                Secondary identifiers are optional. It is OK if an object has no secondary identifiers.
                There may be multiple secondary identifiers for a single object type. In that case it is assumed that all such
                identifier attributes form a compound identifier. E.g. that each unique combination of identifier values
                refers to a different object.

                E.g. LDAP DN, username, unique object name or similar attributes are usually presented as secondary identifiers.

                There are many reasons for taking secondary identifiers into account. The most important reason is the
                uniqueness requirement for secondary identifiers. I.e. a new resource object (e.g. account) cannot be
                created if the value of a secondary identifier conflicts with existing object. When midPoint knows about
                such secondary identifiers, it may read and cache them in shadows. Then it can make a uniqueness check
                for both primary and secondary identifiers by just looking at the shadows. Which is much more efficient
                than trying to create the account on resource and failing (maybe even several times). Secondary identifiers
                may be also used to confirm the equivalence of an object after primary identifier changes and in similar situations.

    <xsd:element name="namingAttribute" type="xsd:QName">
        <xsd:annotation>
            <xsd:documentation>
                Reference to the naming name attribute. This annotation contains a QName of the attribute that should
                be used to "name" the resource objects. The values of such attribute will be used for "name" property
                in shadows and may be also used for other similar purposes. This may not necessarily be human-readable,
                but it should be unique within the scope of the resource. It should also be admin-friendly in a sense that
                administrator should be able to quickly interpret that. E.g. user names, login names, screen name, DNs and similar
                attributes are good candidate for naming attribute.

    <xsd:element name="displayNameAttribute" type="xsd:QName">
        <xsd:annotation>
            <xsd:documentation>
                Reference to the display name attribute. This annotation contains a QName of the attribute that should
                be used as a human-readable "display name" for the resource objects. E.g. if it refers to the ldap:cn attribute then the
                content of that attribute will be used as short name when displaying the resource object to user (e.g. in GUI).
                This should be used for user-friendly values such as cn, full name, etc. There is no requirement for uniqueness.

                Reference to the desription attribute. This annotation contains a QName of the attribute that should
                be used as description of resource objects. Description is a longer (multi-line) free form-text. The
                description may be used as a general comment, it may be displayed when the object details are shown
                to the user, etc.

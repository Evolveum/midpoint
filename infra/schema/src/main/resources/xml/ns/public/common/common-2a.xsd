            This is a common schema for midPoint project. It contains all the
            data types that the stock midPoint is using.

            This file contains more that a common schema in fact. It contains
            all the objects, even parts of what is known as identity schema and
            model schema in midPoint.

                The use of national characters is in "displayName" is fully supported.

    <!-- Basic Object Types -->

    <xsd:complexType name="ObjectType" abstract="true">

        <xsd:annotation>
            <xsd:documentation>
                Common supertype for all identity objects.

                Defines basic properties that each object must have to live in
                our system (identifier, name).

                Objects consists of identifier and name (see definition below)
                and a set of properties represented as XML elements in the
                object's body. The properties are represented as first-level
                XML elements (tags) of the object XML representation and may
                be also contained in other tags (e.g. extension, attributes)
                that are marked by a propertyContainer annotation. The QName
                (namespace and local name) of the element holding the property
                is considered to be a property name.

                Single-value properties must appear as a none or one instance
                of the XML element holding the value.

                Multi-value properties must appear as none or more instances of
                the same XML element. Multi-valued properties are regarded as
                unordered sets. Duplicate values are allowed, but duplicates
                should not be preserved by the implementations. The implementations
                should reduce duplicate values to a single value if it is
                possible and efficient.

                If an element for a specific property does not appear in the
                object it means that the property value is undefined (property
                does not exists). This is a different state as compared to
                passing an empty XML element. Empty XML element means that the
                property exists, but has an empty (null) value. Implementations
                must be able to handle undefined (non-existent) properties, but
                may NOT be able to handle empty (null) values. The use of empty
                (null) values is DISCOURADGED.

                It is not mandated by this specification how to pass ordered
                lists and multi-value properties with duplicates. However it is
                recommended to use single value properties with appropriate complex
                XML data structures to hold such data.

                The following XML snippet is an example of the object (omitting
                namespace definitions, but assuming default namespace to be the
                target namespace of this schema definition):

                <![CDATA[
        <user oid="d3adm3a4" version="42">
            <name>foobar</name>
            <extension>
              <foo:geekName>F00 B4r</foo:geekName>
              <org:guild>Societus Geekus Europeus</org:guild>
              <org:guild>Basset User Group</org:guild>
              <pet:pet><pet:species>dog</pet:species><pet:breed>basset</pet:breed><pet:name>Doggie</pet:name></pet:pet>
              <pet:pet><pet:species>mouse</pet:species><pet:breed>logitech</pet:breed><pet:name>Mousee</pet:name></pet:pet>
              <com:shoppingPreferences>
                  <com:tShirt><com:size>XXL</com:size><com:color>#000000</com:color></com:tShirt>
                  <com:tie><com:preference>no thanks</com:preference></com:tie>
              </com:shoppingPreferences>
            </extension>
            <fullName>Foo Bar</fullName>
            <givenName>Foo</givenName>
            <familyName>Bar</familyName>
        </user>
]]>

                The above example describes an object with identifier "d3adm3a4",
                name "foobar" and type defined by its top-level element User that
                corresponds to URI "http://midpoint.evolveum.com/xml/ns/identity/1#User".
                The object has 7 properties. Three of them are standard
                properties defined by this schema:

                Standard properties "fullName", "givenName" and "familyName"
                in default namespace. These are single-valued string properties.

                All the other properties are non-standard "extended" properties,
                but they are considered equal to the standard attributes. They are
                quarantined in the &lt;extension&gt; tag only to avoid XSD unique
                particle attribution (UPA) problems. In the above example the
                non-standard properties are:

                Property "geekName" in namespace defined by "foo" prefix. This is also
                single-valued string property.

                Multi-valued non-standard property "guild". It is a string property
                with multiple values. Multiple values are represented by providing
                multiple instances of XML elements in the document.
                Such properties are typically used for roles, groups, etc.

                Complex property "pet". This property is defined by
                complex XML type, using XML sub-elements to
                represent structured data. Note that the use of XML attributes
                is discouraged in the properties, although it might be possible in
                some cases. This is also multi-valued property.

                Complex property "shoppingPreferences". This property is using
                complex XML type to form a structure of XML elements to
                represent data. This is a single-valued property.
                Note that the sub-elements "tShirt" and "tie" are NOT considered
                to be properties.

                QName-URI mapping:

                For the purpose of this schema and all components that are using it,
                URIs and QNames are considered equivalent. This is required by WWW
                architecture and also helps avoid some drawbacks and bugs in XML-related
                implementations that usually do not deal QNames well.

                The QNames are mapped to URIs by concatenating namespace URI and a local
                name. If URI does not end with slash (/) or hash (#) character, slash is
                concatenated to the URI before adding the local name. The URI-QName
                mapping is the reverse process.

                        Human-readable, mutable name of the object. It
                        may also be an identifier (login name, group name).
                        Should be unique in the respective context of
                        interpretation. E.g. the name of the UserType subtype
                        should be unique in the whole system.
                        The name of the AccountType subtype should be unique in the
                        scope of resource (target system) that it belongs to.

                        This may not be human-readable in a sense to display
                        to a common end-user. It is intended to be displayed to
                        IDM system administrator. Therefore it may contain quite
                        a "ugly" structures such as LDAP DN or URL.

                        Name is considered to be ordinary property of the object.
                        Therefore it can be changed by invoking usual modifyObject
                        operations. However, change of the name may have side
                        effects (rename process).
                        
                		Name is mutable. It can change any time. However, a special
                		handling may be needed in some cases (e.g. "rename" provisioning flow).

                        Although name is specified as optional by this schema, it
                        is in fact mandatory for most object types. The reason for
                        specifying the name as optional is that the name may be
                        generated by the system instead of supplied by the clients.
                        However, all objects stored in the repository must have a name.

        <xsd:attribute name="oid" type="xsd:string" use="optional">
            <xsd:annotation>
                <xsd:documentation>
                    System-wide immutable identifier for the object.
                    Will be probably quite long and not human-readable. It
                    should not be displayed to user. It has no meaning
                    outside of IDM system and should not be directly
                    passed to any third-party systems.

                    This identifier must be unique in the entire system.

                    This attribute is immutable.
                    It cannot be changed. Any operation attempting
                    to change this identifier must fail.

                    OID is not property and therefore cannot be "addressed"
                    in usual operations.

                    OID must be provided for all objects that are persistently
                    stored. There may be detached objects without OID.
                    Such objects have the same structure as normal objects,
                    they are just not stored in the repository. E.g.
                    object that are only stored on resource and are
                    not replicated in the repository. Such objects
                    do not have OID therefore their XML representation
                    cannot contain oid attribute.

                    The OID should be unique in both time and space. That
                    means that OIDs must be unique in the whole system
                    in any moment and should not be re-used. If an object is
                    deleted, the OID of that object should not be used by
                    a new object. The reason is to avoid problems with stale
                    links pointing to a wrong object and appearing valid.
                    However, this is not a strict requirement. Some marginal
                    probability of OID reuse is tolerated. The recommended
                    practice is to add some randomness to the process of
                    OID generation.

                    This attribute is NOT (necessarily) ASN.1 OID and should not
                    be confused with it.

                    The attribute is named "oid" meaning object identifier.
                    It is not named "id" to avoid confusion with xml:id
                    attribute as it is easy to confuse these two if
                    namespace prefix is omitted. The confusion with ASN.1
                    OID id not likely.

                    The oid is XML attribute of this object instead of
                    element because it has special purpose of identifying
                    the object. It is also immutable, therefore we do not
                    need to handle changes to it.

                                Task (lightweight) identifier. This is an unique identification of any task,
                                regardless whether it is persistent or transient (cf. OID). Therefore this can be used
                                to identify all tasks, e.g. for the purposes of auditing and logging.

                                Task identifier is assigned automatically when the task is created. It is immutable.
                                It is formally set as optional, however it is mandatory for any task to work. Setting
                                it to optional allows creating a task without identifier and generating the identifier
                                during import. However any tasks that live inside midPoint (running or stored in repository)
                                must have valid task identifier.

                                Parent task, used to implement task hierarchies. A task can have a number of
                                children (subtasks) that carry out some of the work. For example, a parent task
                                can contain a complex model operation, and its subtasks contain individual
                                approvals and/or elementary model operations. If null, this task is a "root-level"
                                task that has no parent.

                        task, or the system needs to allocate such thread, or the task is prepared to be started
                        when a defined time arrives.

                        Original meaning:

                        Used in connection with cronLikePattern. If the task is not run
                        at a given time instant (e.g. Monday 8:00 AM), e.g. because the
                        midPoint is not running at that moment, what is the end of the
                        period in which it would be possible to execute this week's task run?
                        Given in seconds. E.g., 3600 means that this weekly task would be able
                        to start from Monday 8:00 AM to Monday 9:00 AM. E.g. 86400 means the whole day.
                        
                        If 0, the task can be run at any time after a missed scheduled time instant.

                        Current situation: Events like this are handled by Quartz.
                        This tolerance is set globally for all tasks via configuration.
                        However, individual tasks can be configured how they should behave

                execution and defer it until some event occurs (e.g. the workflow hook, which may request
                a user approval in order to the operation be continued)

                                may be used to provide easy-to-use data about organizational membership of the user.

                                This is multi-valued property to allow membership of a user to several
                                organizational units. Please note that midPoint does not maintain ordering in
                                multi-value properties therefore this is not usable to model a complex
                                organization hierachies. Use OrgType instead.

                This is a container type for various credentials types: passwords, public keys, one-time password
                scheme identifiers, etc. However, we expect that password will be the most widely used credential
                type and that's actually also the only supported type.

                The reason to "formalize" this structure is the ability to synchronize credentials. If the password
                would be just an ordinary attribute, we cannot automatically synchronize user and account passwords.
                Similarly as other credential types.
                Note: marking password with a special attribute type will not be enough. There may be numerous passwords
                with various meanings, we need to distinguish the "primary" one to synchronize. We also need to store
                user password somewhere.

                This is not perfect. It may change in the future.

                TODO: support for "old password", e.g. some resource need it to change password.

                Generic assignments of one object to another object.
                This will usually be assignment of a role to a user, assignment of an
                organizational unit, team or whatever. It may also be used to assign
                role to another role, creating a role hierarchy.

                Assignment is an abstract concept. It can be anything that
                gives the "receptor" object additional access rights, privileges,
                capabilities or similar ability or right. But it may also constraint
                the object with policy, e.g. to implement separation of duties. Roles,
                organizations and privileges in IDM system are examples of assignments.

                The assignment may target either existing IDM object (such as a role)
                or abstract resource account that may or may not exist. In case of resource
                objects it is constrained to accounts, as accounts are the only resource objects
                that can be assigned to a user. Other resource objects (entitlements) can
                be assigned to accounts, but not to users.

                        Flag that indicates if the described concept is active.

                        true => active, enabled
                        flase => inactive, disabled

                        This defines the "administrative state", i.e. the administrator's decision.
                        If set, this flag overrides any other constraints in the activation type.
                        E.g. if this is set to true and the object is not yet valid (according to
                        validFrom below), the user should be considered active. If set to false the
                        user should be considered inactive regardless of other settings.

                        Therefore this flag does NOT define an actual state of
                        the object. It is a kind of "manual override".

                        If this flag is not present then the other constraints in the activation type
                        should be considered.

                        If not present and there are no other constraints in the activation type or if there
                        is no activation type at all then the values is assumed to be true, i.e. that the
                        described concept is active (enabled).

                Resource represents a system or component external to the IDM
                system which we manage. It is sometimes called _IT resource_,
                _target system_, _source system_, _provisioning target_,
                etc.
                IDM system connects to it to create accounts, assign
                accounts to groups, etc. But it also may be an authoritative source of
                data, system that maintains lookup tables, database that
                contains organizational structure, etc. The {{Resource}} 
                provides a combination of several functions (e.g.
                both provisioning and authoritative data for some attributes).

                                Schema for resource objects.

                                This element contains the XSD-formatted definition
                                of resource schema. It defines data types for
                                accounts, groups, roles, entitlements,
                                organizational units or any other objects
                                related to identity management that the resource
                                supports.

                                Resource schema is only available at run-time
                                and can be diffrent for every resource instance,
                                even for resource instances of the same type.
                                It is supposed to be dynamically interpreted in
                                run-time.

                                Schema defines data types (XSD types), but it
                                does NOT define how these types are handled.
                                E.g. it defines attributes and object class for
                                inetOrgPerson, that it has "cn" attribute which
                                is multi-valued string, etc.

                The schema available in this definition is expeceted to comply

                Note: xsd:any is here, but maybe a stricter type would be preferable.

                        In case an expression is used, the expression variables should be as follows:
                        $user - the user to whom the account belongs
                        $account - the account to be changed

                        Motivation: This is "value construction" type, it is
                        using similar format that is used eleswhere in the system
                        (e.g. in roles) and therefore a common expression processor can be
                        used to process all of that. E.g. a single processor may take into a
                        consideration both schema handling and dynamic attributes set by roles.

                        Defines how the attribute values are used (assigned) in case of information flow from resource
                        to IDM, e.g. in case of synchronization, reconciliation or discovery.

                        In case a source expression is used, the expression variables should be as follows:
                        $user - the user to whom the account belongs
                        $account - the account that has been changed (after the change)

                        Explanation: This is not a "value construction" as it is not constructing a new
                        attribute value. It is rather using attribute value that was set be someone else.
                        A simpler way how to express the assignement is needed here, especially a simple way how
                        to express assignment target. Some rules may use that information and we definitelly need that
                        to
                        generate correct relative change descriptions.

                Defines how a value of a property (or attribute) should be
                constructed. The value may be static or constructed as an
                result of evaluating an expression.

                This structure also defines a method how to merge several value
                construction definitions, how to behave if a property already
                has a value, etc.

                This is reusable data structure, used in schemaHandling, roles
                and it may also be used in may other places.

                Motivation: We need to construct attribute or property values on
                many places in midPoint. E.g. we need that in roles to generate
                dynamic account attribute values, we need that to define "templates"
                for identifiers and default values for attributes when creating a
                new account. We also need that to specify values when creating a
                new user (user templates). Having the same data structure for all of
                these cases may simplify the code, as it all can be handled by a
                generic library reused in many places through the system.

                Defines value filter. The value filters are supposed to take a
                single value of a specific type and return a single value of
                the same type. Filters are used to transforms values, e.g.
                to clean up illegal characters, to do charset transcoding, etc.

                Note:
                Strictly speaking, filters should be used for things like
                transliteration of national characters, case conversions, etc.
                They should not be used to "technical" transformations such as
                character set conversions. Connector should do that and connector                
                should return nice, clean unicode strings. But some connectors
                are faulty and the ability of filters to do "technical" things
                may come handy.

                assigned to the account as-is.

                List of values for the attribute provided in an appropriate XML elements
                that specify attribute name. (as is usual for properties)

                Only one attribute may be specified here, although it may have multiple
                values. Multi-valued attributes are expressed by repeating the same XML
                element multiple times.
                Hence all the XML elements that match this xsd:any must have the same
                element names (may have different values of course).


                Please note that this is nillable and therefore it may be
                explicitly set to "nil" value. Doing this means that empty
                set of values should be constructed. E.g. setting
                this to "nil" and also setting "authoritative" flag
                may enforce removal of all attribute values (if used properly).

                        Flag indicating if the synchronization is enabled. If it is not,
                        the synchronization process will be suspended.
                        If enabled, the synchronization should start with most recent change
                        after enablinh synchronization. It will NOT pull in even the changes that
                        were done during disabled synchronization.

                        If this flag is not present, but a valid synchronization setup is found (which usually
                        means valid "synchrnization" element), the synchronization is assumed to be enabled.
                        This flag is meant to act as a tool to temprarily disable synchronizatoin without loosing the
                        configuration and and state or for forcing the synchronization engine to "skip" some changes.
                        
                        Note that this is different than disabling/deleting the synchronization task. If the task
                        is stopped, midPont will not poll for changes at all. This means that the changes will
                        still be "pending" on the resource and once the task is enabled it will pull such changes.
                        On the other hand, disabling synchronization using this flag and leaving the task running will
                        "acknowldge" all changes without doing anything.
                        
                        Also note that disabling synchronization using this flag will disable all the flavors, e.g.
                        it will also disable import from resource.

            <xsd:documentation>
                Description of a generic connector. Connector in midPoint is any method of connection to the resource.
                The
                actual implementation, connector framework or protocol does not matter.

                The values of "framework", "connectorType", "connectorVersion" and "connectorHost" (if present) together form a unique
                identification of the connector. That means that two ConnectorType objects that have these values same
                represent the same connector. Only one such instance of ConnectorType should exist in the repository.

                Note: The ConnectorType does not describe
                only Identity Connector Framework (ICF) connectors, it is much more generic.

                the LOCAL REPOSITORY. It may represents a minimal data structure in IDM repository
                that contains only identifier and nothing else. It may also represent a rich structure
                with a lot of cached or fetched data. The actual content of this object depends on usage:
                on the specific interface and operation used and even on the system state and configuration.

    	<xsd:annotation>
            <xsd:documentation>
                Attribute values from the resource. The values may be freshly fetched from
                the resource or cached. The set of attributes may be empty, may provide a
                complete copy of the resource object or anything in between. This depends on
                the implementation of the caching and fetching strategy, configuration of the
                provisioning subsystem or operation that was invoked.

                While this object is stored, attibutes set will contain attribute values that
                are (persistently) cached from the resource.

                At the normal case there should be at least attributes that identify the
                resource object on the resouce (identifiers). This will be a single attribute
                in a normal case, something like uid, username, DN, etc. But if a single attribute
                is not enough to identify the account, more than one attribute may be present.

                There also may be no attributes. This can happen e.g. if IDM system knows that
                user should have account on the resource, but the account is not yet created
                and no identifier is yet assigned to it.

                This schema does not distinguish which attributes are idenfiers are which are
                ordinary attributes. That can be learned from the resource schema provided by
                resource or resource connector.

                Motivation: Resource schema is dynamic, the attribute that is identifier for a
                specific object may be different for different resources, even if the resources
                are of the same type (e.g. directory servers with different LDAP schema). And we
                do not really need to know which of the attributes is identifier in the compile-time.
                Knowing that in run-time is enough.

                Please note that this may be out of sync with regard to the resource. In some
                operations (e.g. lookup) it will be only milliseconds old, but in case of stored
                cached values this may be days or even weeks old value.

                Even though there is a single extensible element "attributes", we do not want to put
                its content directly to the body of resource object. Doing so will cause problems
                with UPA rule and it will effectively prohibit the the of type replacement extensibility
                on this object.

            IDM Model schema defines the structure of roles, rules, access policies, 
            method of assignment of accounts and other resource objects and all 
            the properties of access control model. It is based on the identity schema, 
            using concepts of User, Account Shadow and so on. IDM Model schema is 
            static, it is available in compile-time.

            Current IDM model schema defines very minimal RBAC model.
            It is defined as temporary model to allow midPoint to be usable
            while we take the time to design a full-featured complex IDM model.

            Expect that the model will be replaced and do not depend
            on this schema in low-level components (except perhaps repository).

    <xsd:complexType name="RoleType">
        <xsd:annotation>
            <xsd:documentation>
                A role that implies assignments.
                The role may "grant" accounts on resources, attributes and
                entitlements for such accounts. The role can also assign
                organizational units, other roles or various IDM objects
                that can be assigned directly to user. Role is in fact just
                a named set of assignments.

                The specific roles are also called technical role or IT role,
                however this definition is an abstract definition of concept
                that can span wide area of interpretation.

                This is the basic building block of role-based access
                control (RBAC) in the provisioning system. It defines what
                rights (e.g. accounts) should be given to user, how they
                should look like (attributes) and what groups or native
                roles to assign to them (entitlements).

                This role definition is quite simplistic now. It does not
                support rule-derived values or any other advanced dynamics.
                Yet. It will be extended later in the development.

                                In case an expression is used following variables should be set:
                                $user - The user object being created.
                                $account - (optional) the account from which was the user created (if present)

                                Note: the expressions will be evaluated in the order as
                                they are specified in the XML file for now, as the dependency
                                mechanism does not work yet. Later, the order should be insignificant.

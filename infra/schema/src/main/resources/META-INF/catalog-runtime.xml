<!--

The runtime structure differs from the one in compile time: Prism schemas are now stored in this JAR file in the "prism" directory.
(They are copied there when building by maven, see pom.xml.)

BEWARE: This file is pointed to directly from within SchemaRegistry class. So be careful when renaming/deleting it.

This file is used typically when parsing prism schemas from within midPoint
e.g. on midPoint initialization or when generating schemadocs during maven build.

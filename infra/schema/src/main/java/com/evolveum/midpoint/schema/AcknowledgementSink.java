     * It is useful if the acknowledgement itself can take considerable time, e.g. when it involves a communication
     * with an external party.

     * @implNote The item source may be limited in the re-processing options. Examples: (1) Live synchronization can either
     * release all events before specified given token value (in the case of precise token value capability), or it can
     * only hold/release all events retrieved (if this capability is missing). (2) Asynchronous update: Here we depend
     * on the capabilities of the async update source. But even when having the most selective message acknowledgements,
     * retrying a message can cause message ordering issues. So we have to be very careful here.

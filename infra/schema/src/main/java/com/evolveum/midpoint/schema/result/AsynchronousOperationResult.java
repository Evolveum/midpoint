/**
 * Primary goal of this class is to support asynchronous operations.
 * The call to operation may return even if the resource operation
 * is still in progress. The IN_PROGRESS status will be indicated in
 * this class in the operation result. The result may also include 
 * the asynchronous operation reference in the operational status.
 * This reference may be later used to check the status of the
 * operation. 
 * 
 * This may seems too simple and maybe pointless now. But we expect
 * that it may later evolve to something like future/promise.

<!-- This is a meta-role. A Role indented to be assigned to other roles.
     I really mean assigned, not included or induced. 
	 The projections are computed for an LDAP resource and they have a form of LDAP organizationalUnit objects. 
	 This is defined in the schema handling part of LDAP resource definition. 
	 The inducement specifies an (kind, intent) tuple which is used to locate a matching definition in the schemaHandling.-->
